> i woke up to IBM down 10% and spent the morning reading about COBOL.
>
> turns out 90% of all money in circulation runs on it. $50+ trillion sitting on mainframes programmed by people who retired before i was born.
>
> nobody modernized these systems because nobody could afford to understand them first. the knowledge walked out the door with the original developers and never came back.
>
> Anthropic just announced Claude can read COBOL codebases, map the dependencies, and document the business logic.
>
> twitter is split between "this is the biggest thing ever" and "lmao good luck touching a system that processes $3 trillion a day." honestly both reactions make sense to me.
>
> the part that sticks with me: this is the third time in 2026 that Anthropic shipped a feature and an entire industry lost billions in market cap within hours. IBM, CrowdStrike, Adobe. it's February.
>
> i don't know what that means exactly. but i know i've never seen anything move markets like this before. not a company, not a product. a capability.
