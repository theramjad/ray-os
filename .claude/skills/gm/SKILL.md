# /gm — Morning Briefing

## Description
Start your day with a structured briefing: today's calendar, priority tasks,
urgent messages, and upcoming deadlines. Know exactly what matters before
you open your inbox.

## Instructions

You are running the morning briefing for {{YOUR_NAME}}. Follow these steps
in order, collecting information before presenting the final briefing.

### Step 0: Get Current Time

Call the Google Calendar `get-current-time` tool to get the authoritative
date and time. Extract the day of week, date, and timezone. Never guess
the day of week — always verify.

### Step 1: Calendar Review

Fetch today's calendar events using `list-events` with today's date range.

For each event, note:
- Time and duration
- Title and attendees
- Whether it requires preparation
- Any conflicts or back-to-back meetings

Flag:
- Meetings that conflict with hard constraints (e.g., dinner time)
- Back-to-back meetings with no buffer
- Meetings with no clear agenda or purpose

### Step 2: Task Review

**Ray's tasks:** Fetch from Todoist using `mcp__todoist__find-tasks-by-date` with `startDate: "today"`.
Identify:
- Tasks due TODAY (urgent)
- Tasks OVERDUE (critical — should have been done)
- Tasks due in the next 3 days (approaching)
- Tasks that can be completed today given the calendar

**Claude's tasks:** Read `/Users/ray/.claude/projects/-Users-ray-Desktop-ray-os/memory/todos.yaml`.
Check for any overdue or due-today items that Claude should handle (e.g., checking post performance, follow-ups). Present these separately under a "CLAUDE'S TASKS" section.

### Step 3: Goals Check

Read `~/.claude/goals.yaml` and briefly assess:
- Which goals have stalled (no progress update in 7+ days)?
- Does today's calendar align with the highest-priority goals?
- Any goal-aligned work that should be scheduled today?

### Step 4: Inbox Quick Scan (if email MCP is connected)

Do a quick scan of email for anything urgent:
- Search for emails from the last 12 hours
- Flag Tier 1 items (from key contacts, marked urgent, or time-sensitive)
- Don't do a full triage — just surface what's critical

### Step 5: Present the Briefing

Format the briefing as follows:

```
Good morning. It's [Day], [Date]. Here's your day:

CALENDAR ([count] meetings)
- [time]  [title] ([duration]) [any flags]
- ...

[If applicable: "Heads up: [conflict or concern]"]

TASKS
- DUE TODAY: [list or "Nothing due today"]
- OVERDUE: [list or "All clear"]
- APPROACHING: [list of next 3 days]

GOALS
- [Brief status on top 1-2 goals, especially if stalled]

URGENT
- [Any Tier 1 items from inbox, or "No urgent items"]

FOCUS RECOMMENDATION
Based on your calendar and priorities, here's what I'd focus on today:
1. [Top priority]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority, if time allows]
```

### Guidelines

- Be concise. The whole briefing should fit on one screen.
- Lead with the most important information.
- If there are no urgent items, say so — that's good news.
- The focus recommendation should reflect goal alignment.
- If today's calendar is misaligned with goals, say so explicitly.
- End with an offer: "Want me to run a full triage or prep for any of these meetings?"
