Hey friends,

Hope you had a great Monday.

I just posted a new video over on the Agentic Coding School and I wanted to give you a heads up because it's about something I've been thinking about a lot recently.

And that's closing the feedback loop.

Here's what I mean. One of the reasons coding agents work so well is because they have this incredibly tight feedback loop - the agent makes a change, runs the code, sees immediately whether it worked, and adjusts. It knows whether it was right or wrong within seconds.

But when you start using agents for non-coding stuff, that feedback loop just... disappears. The agent makes suggestions, you pick one, and then you never tell it how things actually went.

It's basically like hiring someone, giving them a task, never telling them whether they did a good job, and then wondering why they're not improving.

I've been doing something about this for the last couple of weeks and have seen great results myself. I go deeper into my whole system alongside some practical tips (80/20, inner and outer loops, etc) for you in the video below.

-> Watch it here

This is one of the free lessons from the Agentic Coding School. If you want to check out the rest of the catalogue, you can use the code CLOSETHELOOP at checkout for 20% discount.

I'm curious - if you've been using AI agents for anything beyond coding, have you found ways to close the loop? What's the hardest loop you've had to close for your agent? Hit reply and let me know. I try respond to everyone.

Have a great week :)

**KEY PATTERNS:** Same structure as subscriber version but adds soft sell after video link -> positions video as "one of the free lessons" (lowers barrier, implies more value inside) -> coupon code named after the topic (CLOSETHELOOP) -> keeps the sell to two sentences, doesn't overshadow the content -> adds second question ("hardest loop you've had to close") to deepen engagement
