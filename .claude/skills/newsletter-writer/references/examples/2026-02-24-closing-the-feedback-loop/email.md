Hey friends,

Hope you had a great Monday.

I just posted a new video over on the Agentic Coding School and I wanted to give you a heads up because it's about something I've been thinking about a lot recently.

And that's closing the feedback loop.

Here's what I mean. One of the reasons coding agents work so well is because they have this incredibly tight feedback loop - the agent makes a change, runs the code, sees immediately whether it worked, and adjusts. It knows whether it was right or wrong within seconds.

But when you start using agents for non-coding stuff, that feedback loop just... disappears. The agent makes suggestions, you pick one, and then you never tell it how things actually went.

It's basically like hiring someone, giving them a task, never telling them whether they did a good job, and then wondering why they're not improving.

I've been doing something about this for the last couple of weeks and have seen great results myself. I go deeper into my whole system alongside some practical tips (80/20, inner and outer loops, etc) for you in the video below.

I'm curious - if you've been using AI agents for anything beyond coding, have you found ways to close the loop?

Whether it's feeding analytics back in, having it check results automatically, or something else entirely - I'd genuinely love to know what's worked for you. Hit reply and let me know. I try respond to everyone.

Have a great week :)

**KEY PATTERNS:** Ray's own voice (no "xx" sign-off) -> brief video-redirect format similar to Ali's "22 Habits" example -> teases the concept just enough to hook interest -> relatable analogy (hiring someone and never giving feedback) -> includes image thumbnail for the video -> closes with a question inviting replies -> "I try respond to everyone" adds personal touch
