## 1. "Why Bottlenecks Are Key To Growth"

**Tone:** Honest, practical, slightly self-critical
**Pattern:** Personal business update -> introduce concept -> self-critical honesty -> framework drop (Theory of Constraints) -> specific YouTube story with concrete details -> callback to opening -> actionable prompt

Hey Ray,

Hope you've had a good week.

It's been a busy one internally as we've been onboarding three new coaches for Lifestyle Business Academy (LBA) as we look to scale the product further over the next few months, and the reason for hiring those coaches is actually what I wanted to write about today.

And that's the idea of bottlenecks, or more specifically, the idea that there's usually one bottleneck in a business at any given moment. Not ten. Not twenty. One. And until you identify it and deal with it, almost everything else is basically a distraction.

Now, historically, we've been pretty bad at identifying these and addressing things in order. If I'm being honest, we've had long stretches where we'd have a bunch of important things we could've improved - marketing and onboarding and copy and dashboards and pricing tests and a new funnel idea and "better systems" and "better content" and all the other stuff that feels like "being a serious business person" - and we'd convince ourselves we were being strategic by doing a little bit of everything.

But what we were really doing (and I'm very much including myself in this) was avoiding the one thing that was actually holding the whole business back, because the bottleneck is rarely glamorous, it's rarely fun, and it's almost never the thing you can tinker with for 45 minutes and then feel smugly productive about.

And when you don't make that decision, what happens? You end up spending your time on the important-but-not-urgent stuff: the Notion tidy up, the colour-coding, the "I'll just tweak the copy a bit more", the new shiny object, the minor optimisation that makes you feel like you're moving forward without actually moving the needle. All useful. None of it the real constraint.

There's a framework in operations called the Theory of Constraints, which is a fancy way of saying that a system can only grow as fast as its constraint, so the right question isn't "what can we improve?" but "what is the single thing that, if we fixed it, would make everything else move faster?"

This whole idea really clicked for me years ago with my YouTube channel. Back in 2019 I genuinely thought the thing holding back growth was the usual suspects: "I need better ideas", "I need more time", "I need to be more consistent"...

Then I had a session with a business coach who made me literally draw out the production pipeline on a piece of paper - idea -> script -> film -> edit -> thumbnail -> upload -> publish - and when we looked at the whole chain it was suddenly obvious that the bottleneck wasn't ideas, and it wasn't time, it was editing. Specifically, me editing.

So the solution wasn't "work harder". The solution was to stop being the constraint. I outsourced editing, and almost overnight the whole system sped up.

Which brings me back to the new coaches. For the last few months, the bottleneck for LBA has been coaching capacity... So we did the least sexy thing imaginable: we hired.

Anyway, if you're feeling overwhelmed right now, there's a decent chance you're trying to fix too many things at once. So here's a prompt that might help: if you could only fix one thing in your business in the next 30 days, what would it be? And if you did fix that one thing, which other problems would magically get easier (or disappear entirely)? That's probably your constraint.

Talk soon,

## 2. "The Power of the Pause"

**Tone:** Reflective, gentle, slightly philosophical
**Pattern:** Weekend update -> product mention with self-aware transparency -> concept through personal experience -> addresses reader objection ("wait, didn't you say...") -> numbered practical tips -> invitation to reply

Hey friends,

Hope you had a great weekend - I spent a lot of my Saturday and Sunday journalling on stuff that's already happened this year and just making sure that I'm on track with everything that I outlined back at the Spark summit in January.

I tend to do this journalling the traditional way - i/e pen and paper - and this weekend I was using the new pen that we've been creating with Baronfig. Now, I don't bring this up as a shameless plug for the pen (although you can check it out here if you're interested) - but rather because I wanted to talk more about this idea of liminality and liminal spaces.

As we've been working on this collaboration, this concept of liminal space has begun to take up more and more of my headspace and the more I've realised how much we're all missing by constantly rushing from one thing to the next.

Think about your typical day. You finish a meeting and immediately jump into the next one. You complete a task and instantly start another. You finish reading an article and immediately scroll to the next thing...

There's this great quote from Anne-Laure Le Cunff where she talks about liminal spaces as "the transitional periods where transformation happens" - and it's that transformation that's been lost by our lazy defaults or hyperfocus on optimisation.

It's a bit like the difference between divergent thinking and convergent thinking... We need both. But most of us are constantly in convergent mode.

Now, you might be thinking - wait a minute, didn't you talk about the importance of time blocking last week? Isn't that the opposite of this? Actually, I don't think the two things are contradictory at all.

Here are a few small things I've been building into my routine:

1. Add buffer time between meetings.
2. Go for walks without my phone.
3. Journal in the morning before diving into work.
4. Take an actual lunch break. Revolutionary, I know.

Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is nothing at all.

Hit reply and let me know if you've noticed this pattern in your own life too - I'd genuinely love to hear your thoughts.

Have a great week

## 3. "The subtle buzz of dissatisfaction"

**Tone:** Vulnerable, introspective, meditative
**Pattern:** Meta-commentary about struggling to write -> extremely specific mundane details -> lowered expectations ("not sure how useful this is but oh well") -> intimate moment-by-moment narration -> internal dialogue in quotes -> no big lesson, just honest observation

Hey friends,

It's been a couple of weeks since I've sent an issue of this newsletter. Feels like I need to come up with an interesting insight or something and these days with life settling into a "regular" rhythm it feels like I'm having insights about life a lot less than I used to. I guess a few years ago, I'd spend all my spare time reading personal development books... These days, I don't spend much of my spare time reading personal development books... instead, I finish work by 6:30pm, hang out with my wife and baby, go for a run, then spend the evening on the sofa reading Harry Potter Fan Fiction while my wife watches Bridgerton.

With this sort of pedestrian life setup, I often get to the weekend thinking: "hmm I should kinda be writing an issue of LifeNotes... but I feel like I just don't have anything useful or interesting to share lol"

Anyway, with those lamentations aside, there is something I did want to share this week. Not sure how useful or interesting it is but oh well...

One of the things you learn in meditation is becoming more aware of your own thoughts and feelings...

Here's what tended to happen: it's an evening, I'm hanging with the wife +/- baby (depending on what time it is), reading some Harry Potter Fan Fiction. We start getting ready for bed. I use the toilet, turn on my phone, check Slack and see a bunch of notifications for work-themed stuff... But as I'm getting ready for bed, I feel a subtle undercurrent of... dissatisfaction... colouring my mood. It's like an internal "buzzing" of sorts...

And then I'm like "huh that's interesting, even though I thought I put the Slack messages out of my mind, they're actually still there under the surface"... And then I'm like: "huh that's interesting..." and then I sort-of "smile" at the feeling, in a "thank you for looking out for me, we don't need to worry about this right now" and focus on enjoying the peace and serenity of getting ready for bed.

If any of this resonates, I'd love to know. What's been your experience of the subtle buzz of dissatisfaction? Feel free to hit reply and let me know :)

Have a great week!

## 4. "Time Blocking"

**Tone:** Energetic, practical, encouraging
**Pattern:** Product mention woven into topic -> anticipates reader's exact objection with quoted voice -> "the big reframe" pivot -> "here's literally what I do" -> admits imperfection -> small specific challenge

Hey friends,

Hope you've had a good start to February.

I want to use today's issue of the newsletter to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently as we've been building out SuperOS, our new productivity platform, and that's this idea of intentionality.

Over the last few years of creating productivity content, or speaking to people about how they manage their time, one of the recurring patterns I've seen crop up is that people don't realise where much of their time is actually going...

And as I've tried the different techniques over the years to try to address this issue, it's always come back to something ludicrously simple - time blocking.

Now I know what some of you are probably thinking. "Ali, time blocking sounds way too rigid. I don't want my day to feel like I'm back at school with everything planned down to the minute." And I get it. I used to think the same thing.

But the big reframe that changed everything for me was this: time blocking isn't a productivity hack to squeeze more work out of your day. It's a way to spend your time proactively rather than reactively and when you block time in your calendar, you're not creating restrictions, you're just creating intentions.

Here's literally what I do: once a week (usually Sunday evening or Monday morning), I look at the week ahead...

To be clear, I'm not saying that I've got this perfectly figured out by the way. Just last week I had to take a step back and reassess stuff because over the course of January, I've found that work has increasingly crept into the evening...

My challenge for you this week: block out just 3 time blocks for next week. One for focused work, one for admin, and one for something personal.

Have a great week ahead.

Talk soon,

## 5. "22 Habits That Save Me 25 Hours/Week"

**Tone:** Casual, brief, redirecting
**Pattern:** Shortest format - not every issue needs to be an essay -> meta-awareness about format -> redirects to video -> still invites engagement

Hey friends,

Hope you had a great weekend.

I spent most of mine doing some general improvements around the house which kept getting sidelined by life and also stress testing SuperOS, the new productivity tool we're building.

Anyway, I wanted to send a bit of a different issue this week. We've talked a lot about resolutions and habits over the last few weeks (with it being January) and I realise that sometimes when we have these discussions, there's a tendency to focus on the big stuff - overhauling entire routines, committing to hours of deep work, or making massive lifestyle changes.

But over the years I've noticed that it's not always the large habits that really move the needle. It's the accumulation of the quick, small ones that compound over time and actually make the biggest difference.

And last week, I released a video breaking down 22 of these small habits that collectively save me around 25 hours per week and I was initially going to write this week's email all about them, but then I realised I'd end up with a massive essay that would probably take you ages to get through.

So instead, I thought it would be way more helpful to just send you the video so you can watch me explain it myself.

I'm always on the lookout for other quick habits that people find useful so if you've got any that aren't in the video, hit reply and let me know.

Anyway, enjoy the video, have a great week and we'll speak next Monday :)

Ali xx
