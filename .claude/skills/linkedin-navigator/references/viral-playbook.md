- **▪️ or ✅ or ⚡ Emoji bullets** for lists
- **❌/✅ Contrast pairs** for mindset shifts
- **Bold Unicode text** for headers (𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝘅𝘁)
- **Numbered steps** for frameworks
- **Short sentences.** Three to ten words max. Stack them.

## Media Selection

2. **Event/Multiple Photos** — Avg 896 reactions.
   - Real photos from events/conferences

3. **Meme/Humor Images** — Avg 270 reactions.
   - Must be relevant to audience's pain points

## CTA Patterns

- **Question:** "wdyt?" / "What would you do?" / "Which is your fav?"
- **Engagement bait:** "Comment X to get the guide" (drives 300+ comments)
- **Rhetorical:** "Are you optimising for today's balance sheet, or tomorrow's unfair advantage?"
- **Follow:** "Hit the 🔔 on my profile"
- **P.S. format:** "P.S. Which of these stories is your fav?" (Fatima Khan: 307 comments)

## 8 Viral Archetypes

1. **The Data Bomb** — Shocking stat → comparison → analysis → CTA
2. **The Carousel Guide** — How-to packaged in swipeable document
3. **The Personal Story** — Vulnerability + achievement + gratitude
4. **The Bold Claim** — Controversial statement → evidence → vision
5. **The Meme Drop** — Ultra-short text + viral-worthy image
6. **The Contrarian Take** — "Everyone thinks X, actually Y" + data
7. **The Person A/B Parable** — Two paths, one lesson, narrative format
8. **The News + Insight** — Breaking news + "here's what it means for you"

## Image Design Patterns

1. **Dark backgrounds** with white/bright text (carousel covers)
2. **Large bold typography** for meme-style images
3. **Custom data viz** > stock charts
4. **Real photos** from events/offices > stock photos
5. **Monospace/retro fonts** for tech-related carousels
6. **Flag emojis** (🇬🇧🇫🇷🇩🇪) for international content = visual scanning
7. **Screenshots** of real products/tools as proof

## What to Avoid

- Corporate language / press release tone
- Posts without clear hooks
- Walls of text without line breaks
- Hashtag spam (1-3 max, at end only)
- Pure self-promotion without story/value framing
- "I'm excited to announce" (boring hook)
- Being too polished — lowercase + casual outperforms corporate
- Posting text-only when you could add a carousel
