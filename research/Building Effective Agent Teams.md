- There’s only so much it can do, so much it can follow at the start. 
- Thee's a defined "behaviour space" operate it and once fixed, it struggles to shift.

	- If you translate that into **Claude Code + subagents with personas** (“penny-counter”, “race-hunter”, “hacker”), you can think of persona-assignment as deliberately “tilting” each subagent to explore a different slice of behavior-space — while your orchestrator tries to keep the whole system tethered to the Assistant region so outputs stay grounded and safe.

	- Your subagents are “sampling different points” in persona space
	* That tends to uncover issues that a single “reviewer” persona misses because:
		- a single reviewer’s attention is a bottleneck
		- reviewers regress to generic checklists
		- models often satisfice (find 2–3 obvious issues and stop)
# Uses

- Ask it for a proposal of the kind of teams to spawn up. Giving it chance to think prevents it from following the first path it sees.
