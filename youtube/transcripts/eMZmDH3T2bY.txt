I don't write code by hand anymore. I just ask 
Claude. And in this video, I've partnered with  
Anthropic to break down three things that I wish 
I knew about Vibe Engineering before I started.  
Starting with number one, how to create apps from 
scratch. Head to the link in the description below  
and let's install Claude Code together. First 
up, for Mac users, from the homepage, use this  
copy button to copy the bash script and run it 
in a terminal window. But for Windows users,  
that script looks like this, and it's actually 
PowerShell. Now, I ran into problems with this  
script. So, I'm going to show you another approach 
using npm. If you don't have npm installed or  
you're not sure, head over to nodejs.org. Click 
this big green button that says get NodeJS. Scroll  
down and click the green button to download the 
installer. After you successfully install node,  
you should be able to open a command prompt, type 
in node-v and see the node version returned that  
you have installed. Then you use npm install to 
install cloud code. You can copy this exact line  
from the description under the resources section. 
Then type claude and press enter to set it up.  
First, choose your text style. I'm going to stick 
with dark mode. Then choose how you want to set  
up your subscription. I'm going to stick with my 
cloud account. Go ahead and sign in and I'll see  
you on the other side. Once you've connected 
your account, success means you see something  
like this. Now, Claude Code is great inside of a 
terminal window, but it's even better when it's  
integrated with your IDE. For that reason, I'm 
going to take you through using Cloud Code inside  
of Visual Studio Code. Now, two more quick things 
for setup and then let's jump into our first app.  
First, let's set up a Git repo. You can do that by 
opening a new terminal window by pressing control  
shiftbacktick. Then type get and then press 
enter. Next, we need a command prompt to open  
claude code. So click on this drop-own arrow and 
then click on command prompt. Then type in claude  
and press enter. Press one to trust this directory 
and off we go. Let's create a chore app to manage  
chores at the office. Here are the requirements. 
Show a calendar view like Outlook to see all our  
current chores. allow adding and removing 
chores, make chores recurring on a schedule,  
assigning chores to team members, and 
adding and removing team members. So,  
what do you write inside this little box to get 
started? If you were vibe coding, you might put  
in something like this. Make a chore app to manage 
chores at the office. It should show a calendar  
view like Outlook to see all our current chores. 
But these product requirements are really vague  
and it misses out on technical requirements like 
the tech stack or the storage solution or even the  
architecture as well as engineering principles 
like how you want the code written. So here's  
what I recommend instead. I'll press escape twice 
to clear the prompt area. I'll write a new prompt  
which lists the high priority requirements as 
bullets and then at the end tells Claude to ask  
me questions to clarify requirements, engineering 
principles, hard constraints, etc. By the way,  
you can type new lines in the prompt by holding 
Alt or Option and pressing enter. Finally,  
you need to go into plan mode. So, hold the shift 
key and press tab until you see plan mode in the  
bottom left. Now, when you press enter, Claude 
gets to work. It starts reasoning about the code  
to write and then figuring out what are the right 
questions to ask you to get to the next step of  
its plan. When it's in plan mode, it will never 
write code automatically. It will always confer  
with you first. By the way, I've included this 
prompt and all the prompts from the video under  
the resources section in the description. Here's 
the first set of questions. Your questions may  
differ. Let's make this a React app by pressing 
one. We'll keep things simple by choosing local  
storage. This will run on a big TV screen in the 
office, so no off is needed. Claude's also asking  
us about extra features, so let's turn on two and 
three. If you ever need to change your answers in  
this model, you can use the left and right arrow 
keys to switch between questions. Then press one  
to submit your answers. Claude will now keep going 
until it reaches the next set of questions or it  
completes your plan. Now it's asking us some more 
questions about product requirements. I found that  
when you include this ask me questions to clarify 
the requirements part of your prompt, you'll get  
a richer discussion in plan mode. So now it's got 
all the information that it needs. It's going to  
create the implementation plan for our review. I 
find this process is like working with a teammate  
or fellow senior engineer to help plan exactly 
what you're going to do before you execute. And  
a few seconds later, we get the plan. This is your 
opportunity to review before Claude starts writing  
code. Be on the lookout for design decisions 
Claude has made that you might disagree with.  
Here, for example, we never said anything about 
Vit or Tailwind. Scrolling down, you'll see a good  
summary of the data models, the project structure, 
implementation steps, etc. One thing that stands  
out to me is that this is in JavaScript, not 
TypeScript. So, here's how we tell Claude to make  
changes. When asked, would you like to proceed, 
select option three, and I'll type use TypeScript  
instead of JavaScript. I'll press enter, and 
Claude will reconfigure its plans. By the way,  
notice how I'm talking to Claude. It's like a 
senior engineer that I respect. Clear, firm,  
and specific. You don't need to be overly polite, 
and you don't need to be overly aggressive. Just  
the facts. Okay, the new plan's generated, and we 
see file extensions with TS and TSX. That means  
we're on the right path. And let's assume we're 
good with the rest of the plan. So, it's time to  
move forward. You have two options. You can auto 
accept all of Claude's changes or manually approve  
them one by one. If you're just getting started, 
you might want to choose option two just to be  
sure, but I'll tell you, you're going to get tired 
of it pretty quickly. So, I've suggested to auto  
accept edits here. Let's see what happens in just 
a minute. Claude's just written the entire app,  
which we can see here. Now, it's asking approval 
to run npm install. Claude's default user  
experience is that it always asks for approval for 
these sorts of tools. But if you believe a tool is  
safe to use, I recommend choosing option two here. 
After a few more approvals, Claude asked to run  
the dev server. I'm actually not keen on having 
Claude do this, so I'm going to start up a new  
terminal window, go to the app directory, and then 
start it myself. With the server up and running,  
let's check out the app. Okay, we've got a decent 
looking page here. Let's add a few team members.  
So, I'll start by adding myself. I'll give myself 
a green color. And then let's add Kevin. Give him  
a blue color. Now, that looks okay. So, let's try 
testing the add chore functionality. Let's get  
Kevin to bake us cookies every week. So, we'll 
assign that to kitchen and then assign that to  
Kevin. We'll make this a recurring chore. Repeat 
it once a week and click add. That looks good. So,  
let's check out the week mode. And we should 
be able to see bake cookies down below. Looks  
like we've got a little highlighting bug up 
here. Finally, let's try adding a chore for  
me just by clicking on the calendar. So, we'll 
say maintenance and we'll assign this to David.  
And oh, interesting. The time is also wrong here. 
Let's click add and see where it puts it, though.  
Yeah, it looks like it went down to 8:00 p.m. 
when it shouldn't have. Now, we're all tempted  
to go back into Claude and start prompting it to 
fix these bugs. But you need to follow a principle  
of committing early and committing often. That's 
because when you add more prompts, there's always  
a chance of introducing more regressions. So 
always make it easy to revert to the last known  
good state. By the way, I'm assuming that you're 
working inside of a branch when you commit. This  
is a great time to review the code and iterate 
with Claude. You can try making architecture  
changes or even making test cases. Great job. You 
just built your first app with Claude code, but  
that's not enough to be successful with it. That 
leads us to scenario number two. Using cla code  
with an existing app. We want to pretend that this 
is existing code that you're bringing Claude code  
to. To do that, I'll press escape here and then 
type slashcle. As you can see, that clears all  
of our conversation history and frees up context. 
So, it's like Claude is looking at this codebase  
for the first time. One mental block I had when I 
got started was not knowing how AI would possibly  
understand all of my coding standards so it 
could keep building on them. The answer is a  
file called claude md. According to this blog 
post on humanaylayer.dev, dev, which I'll also  
link in the description. Claude MD onboards Claude 
onto your codebase. The contents of this file get  
injected into every Claude session. So, it's 
super important that the instructions in this  
file are almost universally applicable to the 
prompts that you write. Otherwise, Claude might  
ignore them. So, we can break down what you 
put in this file into three layers. First,  
you tell Claude about the tech stack, the project 
structure, what the packages are, components,  
etc. Then explain the function and purpose of 
each component in the project. Finally, describe  
how you want Claude to work with the project. For 
example, you can instruct Claude to run test cases  
and verify success after every change it makes. 
You have two options to create that cloud MD file.  
You can start with the /init command, but in my 
experience, that doesn't create the three types  
of information we just reviewed. So, I prefer to 
use a prompt. Grab this prompt from the resources  
section and paste it in. As you can see, it covers 
some of the essentials from that blog post I just  
shared, the what, the why, the how, and it pulls 
in a couple of other principles as well. One of  
those principles is to use progressive disclosure. 
So instead of including all the instructions  
for everything at once, create an index that 
points to other markdown files. So like I have  
an architectural patterns file which documents 
architectural patterns, design decisions, etc.  
After a few minutes, you get a claud file. You 
can view a formatted version of this by pressing  
commandshiftv or control shiftv on windows. So 
now every time you start cla it's acquainted  
with the text stack, the project structure, what 
are your key files, commands to run everything,  
domain model, and there's a few more things here 
as well. Just to show this in action, we're going  
to make a small change to the adding new feature 
section. I'll change this to adding new features  
or fixing bugs. And then I'll add a disclaimer 
that it's important when you work on a new feature  
or bug to create a git branch first. Let's commit 
this change. And while I do that, you remember  
that bug that we looked at earlier, the one where 
clicking on the calendar didn't add the right time  
to the chore. Let's go fix this using Claude. 
Now, just to prove that Claude MD is working,  
I'm going to get out of Claude first and then 
restart it and ask the following prompt. Notice  
the prompt is nothing fancy. We say it's a bug 
fix. We describe the failure condition and then we  
let it go. Let's see what Claude does. After a few 
minutes, it finds the bug inside of a TSX file,  
but before it implements the fix, it asks to 
create a new branch. Let's let it proceed. After  
a few more permission confirmations, it creates 
the new branch and makes the fix. Obviously,  
you'll verify that fix on the app itself. We'll 
head back into the week mode. Then, we'll make a  
chore at 8 a.m. We'll call it bring donuts for the 
office. Put it in the kitchen category and assign  
it to me. Then, click add. So, this is good. The 
bug is fixed here. Now, it's time to check the  
code itself. Again, it's useful to think of Claude 
as another engineer on your team. You're going to  
review its code like everyone else's. If you don't 
like something, instead of making a comment, use a  
prompt to get Claude to fix it. That was a small 
bug, but how does it perform with scenario number  
three, a big architecture change? I've just made 
a few more fixes, so our grid is looking good,  
but now it's time to make a bigger change. Changes 
to chores should automatically show up on other  
tabs without refreshing. So, how do we get that 
test chore to show up on other tabs? Let's head  
to Claude and find out. For this change, we'll use 
a special mode of Claude code called YOLO. And no,  
I'm not kidding. It's when you run Claude with the 
dangerously skip permissions switch. In this mode,  
Claude doesn't ask for your approval to 
run commands. It just does them. Of course,  
there's risk with this, but I'm showing you 
because one day the speed might be worth it.  
You can now toggle this mode on and off by using 
shift and tab. Onto the architecture change. Now,  
Cloud Code best practices advises an explore, 
plan, code, and commit approach. You've already  
got the building blocks for this. So, first use 
shift and tab to switch into plan mode. Then,  
our prompt explains the architecture change and 
also tells Claude to explore these files and give  
us three options to move forward. This request 
for three options is a bit of prompt engineering  
because remember any prompt engineering technique 
you've learned with LLMs like chatgpt or claude  
also applies here. After a few minutes given us 
our options. Now there's no web server on this  
app right now. So I tried to trick Claude into 
only giving us browser sync solutions. But it saw  
through that and also suggested option three 
which would create a server and do real-time  
syncing across clients. I'm making this video to 
show you the real power of AI assisted coding. So,  
let's go all the way with option three. I'll give 
it a minute and we'll see the plan together. Here  
we've got Claude's plan. Just like our first 
plan, it gives you an overview of the changes,  
the project structure, files, it's changing, 
a phased approach to implementation, as well  
as key design decisions. You could continue 
to modify this plan by using option three,  
but we'll continue with option one. And because 
we have YOLO mode enabled, we can let this run  
as long as it needs to get the job done. 
In about 5 minutes, it created a websocket  
server and explained to us how it works. So the 
question remains, does it actually work? Here  
I've got two instances of the app side by side. 
Let's start by adding a new team member. Let's  
add Elizabeth and give her red. And we see that 
change in the other browser. Now in this browser,  
let's give her a chore called feed the fish. We'll 
assign it to her and then click add. That chore  
successfully shows up in the first browser. Now 
all that's left is for you to review the code.  
But don't take my word for it that it works. 
Try it yourself. If you enjoyed this video and
