Opus 4.6 was just released and along
with it a really cool experimental
feature called agent teams. Watch this.
I'm going to give Claude this prompt to
build a fitness tracker app called
Claude Fit. And all the requirements for
this app can be found in this document.
This is just a really simple PRD with
all the core features. But here's the
difference. Create an agent team to
implement this from different angles. So
the team members are the UX UI designer,
a back-end developer, a technical
architect, a database expert, and a team
member that plays devil's advocate. This
team member will basically question
everything the other team members do.
And then for each team member, we want
to use Opus as the driving model. So
I'll simply copy this and let's send
this to Claude. So Claude is now going
to create five specialized agents to
implement the solution. But first, it's
going to create a task list and then
create those specialized agents. And now
we can see all our team members are
indeed running. Now, what's really cool
is that we have access to all of the
individual team members. So, we can
simply go through each of these. The
main agent is the team lead, but we can
also access any of these team members by
simply pressing enter. And now we're in
the chat interface for this specific
team member. And this is really cool.
Each and every team member has its own
claude code instance. So we can do
everything that we would usually be able
to do in a claude session. For example,
I'm going to go to the UI designer and
I'm going to press escape to interrupt
the UI designer. And this did not affect
any of the other team members. By the
way, you can see they're all running.
It's only the UI designer that's
currently idle. So now I can say please
use the front end design skill to assist
you with the UI design. Let's send this.
And now this message was sent to the
front-end designer only. So I'm actually
just going to go back to the team lead
and wait for this process to complete.
Now you might be wondering how this is
different to simply using sub agents.
For sub agents, the main agent can kick
off an agent to run in the background to
perform a very specific task like file
exploration, research, or even making a
certain code change. And of course, the
main agent can run multiple of these sub
agents in parallel at the same time.
Now, these sub agents cannot interact
with each other. Each of these sub
agents have their own context window.
They will go and perform their task and
simply report back to the main agent
once done. So, this really is a one-way
reporting mechanism back to the parent
agent. One sub agent does not have a
view of what another sub agent is doing.
So, sub agent one in theory could
implement a change that's actually not
compatible with what sub agent 2 is
doing. And this is very different when
it comes to agent teams by the way. Now,
agent teams on the other hand is
fundamentally different. This is the
equivalent of bringing a bunch of people
into the same room and they can converse
with each other to work together to
achieve a task. After we sent our
prompt, the first thing our main agent
did was to create a task list. And then
the main agent created all of these team
members and the main agent itself became
the team lead. Now each of the team
members including the team lead shared
this task list and they can all
communicate directly with each other.
For example, one agent might focus on
the database schema and another agent is
responsible for building all the API
endpoints. These two agents can actually
talk to each other so that the API agent
knows exactly what the schema is going
to look like. And each of these team
members have their own context windows
as well. These team members have direct
peer-to-peer messaging as well. So they
can chat to each other and they will
coordinate their efforts automatically
because they share the same task list.
Agent teams is really meant to implement
complex changes. So, if you just want to
do like a once- off task, you should
definitely use sub agents instead. But
for complicated tasks like setting up an
entire project from scratch, agent teams
can definitely help you get way better
results out of the box. And it's so cool
to be able to simply jump between these
team members to see exactly what they're
doing. And because this supports human
in the loop, you can simply stop the
conversation, ask the specific agent a
question, or even give a different
instructions. All of this just works.
And as these agents are completing their
work, the team lead agent is
automatically shutting down these
different team members. And each of
these team members have access to
skills, MCP servers, everything that the
cloud code instance would usually have
access to. So let's have a look at
setting this up. And it's actually
really easy. I'll link to this article
in the description of the video. At the
moment, this is an experimental feature.
And that's what this section is saying
over here. But in my experience, this is
really stable. I haven't actually had
any major issues using this at all. To
enable agent teams, we need to add this
property to the settings.json file. So,
I'm simply going to copy this. Then, in
your project folder, if you don't have a
claude folder, simply create a
new.claude file. Then, in that folder,
create a settings.json
file and then paste in that property.
You can now start your very own agent
team simply by adding something like
this to your prompt. Create an agent
team to explore this from different
angles. And then you can simply describe
the team members that you want. I really
like adding this devil's advocate team
member as it seems to really question
everything and just get a way better
response out of it. Then you can also
specify the model for each of your
teammates by just saying something like
use Sonnet or Opus or Haiku, whatever
you want for each of the teammates. Or
you can assign a different model for
each of your teammates as well. Or you
can just add an instruction like this to
request that the pan needs approval
before they make any changes. You can
also enable delegation mode. So in claw
code you can just press shift and tab
while the team is running and that will
enable delegation mode which means that
the main agent will not make any changes
itself. It will purely rely on the team
members to complete all the changes. And
as I showed you earlier, you can chat to
the teammates simply by holding shift
and pressing the up and down arrow to
cycle between the different teammates.
And then when you press enter, you can
send a message to the teammate like you
would do with your normal C code
instance. The team lead should
automatically shut down the team members
once they're done. But if they don't,
you can just provide this prompt like
ask the researcher teammate to shut
down. That's all you have to do. But
personally, I haven't had that issue
myself. Now, finally, let's have a look
at our app. Let's run npm rundev. And
this [snorts] looks awesome. The font,
the color scheme, the design, everything
just looks like a fitness tracker app.
