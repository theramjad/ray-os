Enthropic has been truly moving fast
lately between new models and major
upgrades to Cloud Code. They have been
shipping non-stop and today they're back
again with two massive upgrades to
Claude Code. And honestly, it is pushing
AI coding assistance into an entire new
category. And I'm not exaggerating when
I say this cuz it started to feel like
software engineering is fundamentally
changing. Today we even saw a new
research from Meter which was estimating
that the Claude Opus 4.6 6 now reaches
roughly 14.5 hours on 50% time horizon
on real software tasks where it
basically means that tasks that would
normally take a human developer an
entire workday are now completed
successfully by an AI the opus 4.6 six
in about half the time. Enthropic has
clearly been focusing on automating more
and more of the developer workflow. And
now with the new latest cloud code
update, that vision is becoming real.
Cuz with the new Cloud Code desktop, it
is something that can now preview
running applications, review your code
automatically, and it can even handle CI
failures and pull requests in the
background while you're actually working
with your prompts. And on top of that,
Enthropic also introduced something
pretty new, which is the cloud code
security update. This is a new feature
that is currently in a limited research
preview, but essentially it scans entire
code bases for vulnerabilities and
proposes targeted software patches for
human review. This is going to help
teams detect and fix issues that
traditional security teams took a lot of
time to essentially review through all
of your code bases. There's a lot more
that's packed into this release, so
let's dive straight into it. Before we
get started, allow me to introduce
today's video sponsor, Mammoth AI. If
you ever wished you could easily access
every leading AI model in a single
place, odd, GPT, Gemini, Deepseek,
Grock, whatever you name, Mammoth does
exactly that. Plus offers a powerful API
that you can plug into tools like Pine,
VS Code, N, and many others. Right now
in AI, we're seeing massive upgrades
with Google's Gemini models, known for
huge context and multimodal reasoning.
We also have Enthropic with its pod
models which are tuned for longer tasks
like coding, spreadsheets, and research.
Then we also have emerging contenders
like Deepseek or Kimi all launching new
models within the next few months. All
of these models are accessible and
easily ready to use within Mammoth where
you get access to many of these models
in a single spot without switching APIs
without any sort of hassle. It comes
with a flexible pricing from just $10 a
month. You can use it for deep research,
code generation, multimodal workflow,
document analysis, and custom AI
projects. Use the link in the
description below to get started. and
thanks to Mammoth for supporting this
channel. [snorts] To start off, let's
talk about the new Claude Code desktop
update. Honestly, it's probably the best
way for you to handle front-end work
right now, cuz with the preview feature,
Claude can spin up your app, take
screenshots, and iterate automatically
until it exactly is showcasing what you
want. This way, you get to actually
visualize everything being edited. And
it's similar to artifacts, but a lot
more upgraded. Because with this you
have server previews where it can
actually spin up a dev server and
preview your running app right inside
the desktop interface. It doesn't just
stop there because cloud can read
console logs for you. It can catch
errors. It can keep iterating in real
time. So you don't need to actually
continuously check on what is not
working cuz this is something that can
autonomously fix issues faster than you
can. like it's super easy nowadays cuz
this is essentially where I had
requested it to create a modern coffee
store website while just providing this
sample image and it was able to spin up
a server on my local host and honestly
just take a look at the quality of
output from just that simple prompt and
a sample image. It's able to do a great
job with the front-end capability of
creating this app with dynamic
movements. You have beautiful
placeholders for each and every
individual image. You have a lot of
features that have been attributed to
this landing page. And honestly, it is
something that would probably take a
developer multiple days and hours to
fully configure all this. But this is
just overall going to make the whole
process of just developing within Cloud
Code a lot easier cuz Cloud Code has the
ability to do practically everything
that you can within your code editor,
but autonomously. and much better
because you have the ability for local
code review. You can preview and
annotate directly within cloud code.
Deploy multiple sub aents to tackle
these tasks and it's going to
autonomously resolve errors that are
prevalent within your overall logs. And
this is an easy way for you to actually
have it so that you can open up a pull
request and have Claude actually track
the CI and have autofixes enabled to
basically have it commit changes and
make sure that everything is perfectly
fine. which you see over here that it
was able to even publish a PR
autonomously onto my GitHub repo which
we can actually open up and take a view
cuz this is where it was able to add the
modern coffee store and add it to our
GitHub repo for it and add a summary of
what it had actually accomplished. But
that's actually not all. When you're
actually reviewing over all of the
diffs, you can actually obviously view
the diffs, but if you see review code,
you can deploy multiple agents to
essentially review through all of it.
Now the reason why it failed is because
I have already ran the review agent
where it has fixed multiple errors
within within this codebase. But that's
not all. You also have local code
reviewers cuz this is where once you are
ready to push your code, you can just
hit the review code feature where Claude
leaves inline comments on all of your
bugs and issues before your code even
goes into full review, which is going to
be a really helpful feature and going to
essentially just take away the fact that
you need to review through all of your
bugs. This is going to automatically
resolve all of this and it makes it even
easier because you have PR monitoring
where you can open a poll request and
clot is going to be able to track the CI
in the background. This is with
autofixes and it tries to resolve
failures automatically. And with
automerge enabled, you can have PRs land
as soon as the check passes, which is
definitely a game changer cuz you can
literally work on your next task while
Claude handles the last one. You also
have session mobility. This is
essentially where you can now move while
you're working with the sessions on your
desktop. You can bring it to the CLI
session. You can even bring it to your
desktop app or even the mobile app. And
you can control everything from these
different avenues. If you want the best
AI tools, workflows, and drops before
everyone else, join my free newsletter
with the link in the description below,
which is completely free. But that's not
all guys cuz claude code also introduced
cloud code security. This is something
that is currently within preview and it
is designed to help anyone find and fix
any sort of issue within your codebase
that traditional tools usually often
miss. So unlike any sort of UI based
scanner or something that is going to
take multiple reruns to find issues,
Claude is going to autonomously read and
reason about your code like a human
security researcher that can understand
how components interact, trace data
flows through any sort of complex
problem that you have within your
codebase. It has automated code
scanning. You have multi-stage
verification. Human in the loop is also
prevalent and even dashboard
integrations where you can inspect
findings, approve fixes as well as
iterate directly within cloud code. So,
this is kind of leading me to think like
it is coming to a point where cloud code
is essentially just automating the full
developer workflow where you're not even
going to need to use a codebase or any
sort of VS Code styled editor to make
changes directly cuz you can just have
these incredible models do the work for
you cuz it can autonomously fix and
build almost any component for you. Now,
unfortunately, the security feature is
not available for everyone. It's going
to be rolling out within the next few
weeks, but you can join the wait list to
maybe get access early for this new
feature. Interestingly, another subtle
new feature is that they have a built-in
git workree support for cloud code. Now,
this is where agents can run in parallel
without interfering with each other.
Each agent gets its own work tree so
that you can actually work independently
and safely on different branches and
tasks. This is something that has been
already supported within the cloud code
desktop app and it is a new capability
that is coming within the CLI as well
making parallel workflows much easier.
Boris the creator of cloud code has an
in-depth thread talking about this which
I'll leave in the description below that
talks about how you can use it with uh
different agents in isolation. You can
use the work tree mode in the desktop
app as well as with sub agents. So, this
is giving you a lot of flexibility in
using uh agents in a safer environment
and workflow. If you like this video and

remarkable for AI. We're seeing
state-of-the-art models, new
technologies, new tooling, new systems
that are just getting better and better
and we're starting to see automation
actually interfere with whatever uh
regular jobs are prevalent in our
day-to-day lifestyle. This is just going
to keep on getting better and better.
