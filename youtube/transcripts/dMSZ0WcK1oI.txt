There is a broad variety of tools you can
use for agentic
engineering,
so for working on code with help of AI.
And amongst the most popular these days,
of course, are Claude Code,
OpenCode, Cursor,
and Visual Studio Code with GitHub
Of course, there also
is Google Antigravity.
There is Codex, Gemini CLI,
and you know what?
These are tools I've used a lot over the
last couple of months though,
simply because I continuously wanna test
what's available and how well
these tools work.
I've built actual projects like
buildmygraphic.com and more projects
which are about to be released
soon and many internal projects,
and I've built entire
courses like this one here,
which I recently updated,
Cursor and GitHub Copilot,
or this one here which I released
yesterday where I dive into Claude Code.
But in this video,
I wanna give you an overview of these
tools, their different capabilities,
and my opinion on them.
And the first important difference,
of course, is that we can kind of divide
them into two camps, if you will,
because we have
the CLIs or TUIs, the terminal user
interfaces or command line interfaces,
and we got those
IDEs here. Now, to be fair,
OpenCode actually has a web mode too,
so you can start, uh,
a local server on your system
and then use a web user interface for
working with
OpenCode, but the default mode in
which I've only
used it is the TUI mode, which
is then the same kind of
mode you have with Claude Code.
So where you run OpenCode after
installing it in one of your projects
and you then interact with it
from inside your command line,
inside your terminal, just as it's the
case with Claude Code by default.
It's worth pointing out that
both OpenCode and also Claude Code have
IDE integration,
so they can integrate with those
IDEs, and, for example,
show code changes or
previews of the intended code changes in
the IDE, or allow you to
interact with them in an IDE.
Those integrations
exist, but I think it's fair to say
that they're
really optimized and primarily built to be
used from the
command line, from the terminal,
therefore.
So that's what I mean when I say they
are CLIs or TUIs,
terminal user interfaces.
One important reason for
why Claude Code and OpenCode
are primarily built for the
terminal or to be used as an extension in
existing
IDEs instead of being VS Code forks like
Cursor or
Wind Surf, for example, are, is,
of course, that for the
developers,
this gives them more flexibility,
say.
They don't need to worry about all the
IDE needs to have. Instead,
they can focus on
building good agents, good tools that
can help you generate
and edit code with AI.
Now, of course, one downside,
if you wanna call it like this,
is that, of course,
these IDEs therefore offer a bit
more than just AI agents, just chat
interfaces for you to interact with.
Cursor, for example, has, uh, amazing
auto-completion,
where you can really fly through your code
base by hitting tab, tab, tab
and applying edits f- in an
entire file and even across files,
and I would say GitHub
Copilot has decent auto-completion.
It's definitely worse than Cursors,
in my opinion, but it's also
good, and most importantly,
it's there because, of course, with, uh,
these CLIs, with Claude Code and OpenCode,
there is no
auto-completion in your editor,
at least not powered by these
tools. They are instead agents or
agentic tools, which means
that you interact with a chat
that triggers a AI, you could say. So
that is
what these tools are, and, of course,
Cursor and VS Code with GitHub
Copilot also offer
that in addition to the auto-completion.
You have that, uh,
sidebar here in VS Code where you can
interact with GitHub Copilot
and you have the same in Cursor, of
course. But with OpenCode and Claude Code,
that is your primary and
only way of interacting in the end.
Now, of course, since they
are AI agents in the end,
or since they are about agentic
engineering, one of the questions that
matters the most is which AI models
are supported by
these different tools? And here,
for Claude
Code,
that is essentially Anthropics models, so
talking Haiku, Sonnet, and, of course,
Opus
there, and because Claude Code
is by the same
company as these models, Anthropic, the
integration is, of course, pretty good,
and these models, in my experience, tend
to work really well in Claude Code.
And I'm saying that because, of course,
these same models are also
available in these other tools.
When using GitHub
Copilot, I can, of course,
select those Anthropic
models as well,
but they run in a different harness
here. They run in the GitHub Copilot
or the Cursor harness or the
OpenCode harness,
and all these harnesses are also
good, but especially
that combination of Claude Code with those
models is really good in my experience.
It is worth mentioning though
that very recently, there also
has been an announcement
that Claude Code also integrates with
Olama, and in case you don't know,
Olama is a tool that can be used to
run open AI models on your system, if your
system is capable enough for that,
of course.
So you can, in theory,
use Claude Code with open
models,
which kind of makes it free because
only paying for your electricity there,
of course.
The downside is that these models,
at least right now, are
typically not as capable as the......
Anthropic models, especially like Opus,
for example.
And even if they are or were,
we would be talking about models that
need lots of GPU RAM, lots of
video RAM,
and quite capable hardware resources in
general, to put it like this.
So they would not run on your laptop or
your Mac Mini or whatever it is.
So that's worth
noting, but the support is there and,
of course, depending on your system and
the development of future open models,
that might be a viable
option. So we also have that Olama support
here. Now, you can also use Olama with
OpenCode and Cursor and VS Code,
and all those
other tools also support lots of other
models. I mean, in OpenCode,
if you just type
models, you'll find a very long list of
models to choose from,
from different providers,
also from different subscriptions you may
have.
Now,
there has been a time where you could use
with your Claude Code Max subscription for
example, and you could
use those Anthropic models in OpenCode
through that
subscription, which
was pretty nice because I personally
prefer the UI, and in many parts also the
behavior of OpenCode over Claude Code.
I think OpenCode is a really amazing piece
of software.
It's also open source by the way,
I'll get back to that.
But Anthropic cracked down on that,
and you can no longer
use your Claude Code Max subscription in
OpenCode.
You can, for example,
use your GitHub Copilot
subscription though. So you can use
that subscription
here with OpenCode,
of course also with GitHub Copilot,
and that of course
is pretty nice because then you have the
which you already may be paying for,
and you can try those models in
OpenCode besides using them, of course,
in GitHub Copilot and VS
Code for example, so that's pretty nice.
But no matter which payment model you're
using, you have access to
many,
many models in all these three tools.
Not so much in Claude Code though.
Now I already just mentioned it:
OpenCode is open source. It
is open source and the
advantage of that, of course,
is a very transparent development,
driven development, rapid innovation,
though I will say that's true for
all these tools essentially. Um,
maybe GitHub Copilot
is lagging a bit but they're also very
quick at catching up and
implementing all the, uh,
features other tools may be adding.
But nonetheless, it's pretty nice
that OpenCode is an open source
alternative, community driven.
Nonetheless, OpenCode also
offers a subscription. There
is OpenCode Black which
offers different tiers just like the
Anthropic or the GitHub
Copilot subscriptions
or the Cursor subscriptions, of course,
included usage so
that you don't have to pay for the
actual usage,
but instead you have a flat fee
usage so to say.
So that's available here as well even
is open source.
So we have paid subscriptions
available for Claude Code, OpenCode,
Cursor also has them, and also
there are subscription plans for GitHub
Copilot.
Now for Claude Code you need a paid
subscription.
For OpenCode it is optional.
And as mentioned,
Copilot subscription in OpenCode. That
is an option too.
What's worth noting here is
that of course OpenCode
is pretty much the only tool
that needs to be
profitable, I would guess at least,
because
it's not a big VC funded company
or anything like that.
It's not Microsoft like in the case of
GitHub Copilot.
So they kind of have to find a model where
they make money with
those subscriptions. Claude Code, Cursor,
and I
guess also GitHub Copilot in the end
are all heavily subsidized
by their companies because they're either
VC funded or
Microsoft So you get probably a bit more
usage
out of your Claude Code, Cursor,
and GitHub Copilot plans than you may
be getting out of OpenCode. But
that of course also depends on
which models you're using and so on,
and it may not actually be a problem.
Now let's talk features.
Which features are supported?
The short answer is
if there's a good feature in one model,
quick to catch up.
Now to me it seems as if
Claude Code has been the, the driver
of many new features,
so has to some degree been
Cursor.
GitHub Copilot tended to lag behind a bit
but if we look at features, which
are by the way also
all covered in my recently released Claude
Code course and also in that AI for
developers course I mentioned,
if we look at features like sub-agents,
look at features like agent skills,
they are
supported by all these tools.
So you will find respective
entries in the documentation of OpenCode
and
also of all the other providers. So they
all have these features available.
The one thing worth noting maybe is
that in case of
OpenCode, agents is a term
that kind of comprises
two things you could say.
It's a combination of different
modes in which you can run OpenCode
and agents to
which work can be outsourced.
In Claude Code's
case, uh, an agent
is really just a sub-agent that's invoked
f-
to perform a specific task like explore
for example. In OpenCode,
you have different
agents through which you can cycle with
the tab key for example
to switch between plan mode and edit mode,
so you have a plan and
an edit agent In Claude Code these things
are called
modes.
So that's something worth noting
all these features like agents
and skills in all
these tools.
And if it's missing in one tool,
supported. The same is true for memory or
rules files, they
are also supported in all these
tools so that you can set up files in
which you set up some general rules that
should always be followed.....
or where you share some learnings that
should be considered by all chat sessions.
Here in Claude Code,
it's the Claude.md file and you can also
set up some,
some rules in the rules directory.
But in open code,
that would be the agents.md
file and also, the claude.md file.
So, that supports both. Agents.md is, in
theory, an open standard which is indeed
supported by Cursor as
well, so we have, uh,
agents.md in Cursor as well
and also, in GitHub Copilot.
Cursor then also has its own
Cursor rules and GitHub Copilot has its
own
GitHub Copilot rules, so that's there in
addition. Uh, here, that would be my, uh,
Claude rule,
so those are not compatible
and that's kind of the annoying part here.
As you see, in theory,
agents.md would be compatible
and would be shared,
but Claude Code plays apple here
support agents.md.
Instead it has claude.md, but that is
supported by open code,
but not by the other tools,
So yeah, that is kind of annoying.
And in general, also when it comes to
these Agent Skills, for example, they
are supported by all the different models,
but they have to be stored in very
different, uh, folders.
So for example,
when you're using open code,
in an open code skills folder or in
Claude Skills. It does support
that for compatibility.
If you're working with Claude,
it's just the
Claude Skills folder that is supported.
With Cursor, it's Cursor Skills or
also Claude Skills
or Codex Skills for that
compatibility, but not open code skills.
And with Visual Studio Code
and GitHub Copilot, it is
.GitHub Skills or also Claude Skills.
So Claude Skills works everywhere,
but as you can also
see, we're still in
that age where a lot of things are
still evolving and every provider tries to
have its
own configuration, its own settings and,
and force
that upon others, so yeah.
That will definitely change in the future
I'm sure in a year or two,
it will all be way more standardized.
But right now,
it's lots of different folders
at in the documentation. And of course,
things also change frequently, and when
this video comes out,
some things may already be different,
These tools also all have support for MCP
servers so that you can, for example,
install the Playwright server to give
them browser access.
They have access to web fetch
so they can send web requests so
that you can, for example, tell them to go
to some documentation page
and read the content from that page,
course, useful. And therefore,
ultimately from a pure feature
perspective, from my experience,
there aren't a lot of differences.
Sure, configuration settings may differ,
some niche feature may
exist in one tool but not the other.
But when it comes to the main features on
which there is some
consensus that they are good, they
are typically supported in all the
tools. And as I mentioned earlier,
if a good feature is added and
tool, you can be sure
that it will be added there soon enough
But what about the quality of these tools?
What's my verdict on these tools?
Which one should you use?
Which one produces the best results?
I'm sorry, but ultimately, all these
tools are decent Super boring answer,
I know, but
what should I do? They are all decent.
I've used them all and there
is no tool here where I would say, "That's
horrible." As I said initially,
in my experience, Claude Code works
really well, especially
when used with Opus because it's
the harness by the same company
that built the tools.
You can kind of feel that.
You get really good results out of Claude
with those Anthropic Models.
I also will say, though, that there was
a period where I felt like GitHub Copilot
gave pretty good results
with those Anthropic Models,
to some degree better,
subjective and may depend on the exact
project you're working
on. Now, what I definitely do like is
that with open
code and Cursor and GitHub Copilot,
I can also use other models
because, for example, there is the
GPT-5.2 Codex model. I think it's,
that's the name. It's, uh,
an amazing model
for coding that's not available in Claude
Code, that is
available in these other tools
and it's a model I
like a lot. I like to use that,
for example, for more complex
tasks, so that's
when I switch over to open code.
I have a GitHub Copilot subscription,
so I can use that through that
subscription.
Or with a Cursor subscription,
So, that is when I would switch,
when I want to use a model that's not
available in Claude Code. Or,
I'll also be honest, sometimes or
for certain tasks,
I prefer having an IDE because I know
to do more edits on my own because I wanna
have,
like, a nice div view Of course,
Cursor and GitHub
Copilot,
once they're done with their changes,
changed and you can accept
or deny these changes on a
change-by-change basis. And there
are certain tasks where I
like having that, so
that would be situations where I use these
IDEs instead.
If we're just talking about the code
quality, then again, as mentioned,
I can't really
say that one tool is worse than the
others.
It's AI,
and I've had very bad results with all of
I had good results with all of them,
and the most important part will
always be your prompt,
the context you provide, that you
use features like Agents and Skills.
Especially Skills can be very useful for
providing extra
knowledge, but that, of course,
then applies to all these tools.
That is your task as a developer because
we're not talking about
live coding here.
We're talking about agentic engineering,
your skills as a developer,
where you try to give the AI
information it can work with,
and where you review the
solution the AI came up with. And here,
all these
tools can do a good job
