Clog code in 2026 is not what it was
when it launched almost a year ago. And
if you're just coming into AI assisted
development right now, I get why it
might feel overwhelming with all the
noise of the past year. Frameworks and
elaborate systems for managing your
agents and custom cursor rules and MCP
servers and swipe files for prompts. I
mean, there's a mountain of advice out
there telling you that you're using the
tools all wrong or that you need to
master this entire ecosystem before you
can even be productive with cloud code.
And look, I'm someone who created one of
those frameworks myself, a popular one
called Agent OS. And I'll be the first
to tell you that here in 2026, most of
it is overkill. These days, pure vanilla
clawed code with Opus 4.5 is all I
actually need for 90% of my daily work.
Yeah, I said it. Now, before you think
I'm about to tell you that my Agent OS
project is obsolete now, hold that
thought because in my next video, I'll
show you the updates that are making
Agent OS lighter and leaner for how we
build in 2026. But here in this video, I
want to show you what building with
Cloud Code and nothing else actually
looks like here in 2026 and why the path
forward is simpler than it looks. Now,
if you're just finding my channel, I'm
Brian Castle. I help professional
builders stay ahead of the curve with
AI. And every Friday, I send my builder
briefing. That's a free 5-minute read
where I give you my real take on what
I'm seeing in our craft and our industry
week to week. No hype, just what's
actually working. You can get yours by
going to buildermethods.com.
And if you're serious about adopting
Claude Code this year, I just launched a
new course for 2026 called Build with
Claude Code. And that's available to
Builder Methods Pro members along with
our community of builders. And so to
show you what I mean, I'm going to build
a real feature in one of my real apps
right now. And so this is inbox
summaries. It's a tool that summarizes
feedback and messages from my audience
and sends me regular reports and trends
on and insights. And so this is the app
that I have uh running locally here. And
uh and so here is like one of the
reports that it sends me every week. Um
you know, showing me some like audience
research survey insight data. So, I get
these every week with some trends and
some data points, but I want to kind of
pull together all of the overall
insights into a new trends view over
here. You know, something visual with
like graphs and metrics. So, I'm going
to show you how I would go about just
beginning to plan this feature and then
building out a spec. And then we'll
actually build it out in this video. So,
I'm going to start by launching Claude.
And I have a shortcut to launch it in
YOLO mode. I like how they still have
the uh the the winter theme here. Now,
first thing I'll do is tab into plan
mode. Um, most big features I always
start off in plan mode, but I'm actually
not even ready to have it create the
actual plan or the spec just yet. First,
I still need to plan out like what
what's going to go into this feature,
what's in scope, what's out of scope.
Right? So, I'm going to start off with a
simple prompt and I'll just use uh some
voice dictation for this. I want to add
a trends view, analyze all of the
functionality around those areas and
suggest some ideas for what we might put
into this trends view and make some
suggestions as to which items should be
included in a V1 of this feature and
which items might add complexity that we
should probably push off for a future
phase. So, you know, I'm just starting
off by voicing some of the actual
strategic product planning questions
that I would have in my mind and I would
want to think through. I'm just going to
pose those to Claude, which has full
access to my codebase and uh and it's
going to come back with some ideas. So,
let's let it cook on that. Now, as you
can see, it's analyzing my existing
codebase, and it launched three agents
uh under the hood. You know, Cloud Code
just decided to do that. It's
essentially using sub agents, and
they're running in parallel. It it sent
off three different agents to explore,
you know, different parts of my codebase
to help inform its answer to my
strategic planning questions. You know,
the amount of change that's happened
just in the past year has been
unbelievable. Less than 12 months ago,
cloud code was brand new. Yeah, the
models back then were capable but
inconsistent. We'd prompt and sometimes
get great results, and other times it'd
be completely off. And there were real
gaps in our workflow. And so those of us
who've been excited about where AI in
software development could go, who could
see the potential even through the rough
edges, we felt those gaps acutely. We
wanted this to work. We could see it was
close, but the tooling wasn't quite
there yet. So we built things to fill
those gaps. And that's why I created
agent OS. I wanted a way to inject my
standards into cloud code. I wanted a
planning phase that would ask me
clarifying questions before building
anything. I wanted task tracking and
structured specs. And I wasn't alone.
Frameworks and custom setups
proliferated last year because
experienced builders were trying to
bridge the gap between what cloud code
could do at the time and what we needed
it to do. And that was the reality of
2025. All of that tooling created a kind
of noise. If you stepped away for a few
months and then came back, it looked
like you needed to learn 15 different
systems just to be able to use cloud
code effectively. All right, so Claude
finished its analysis and it came up
with a few clarifying questions to help
me think through uh the scope of what
should go into this feature and and
maybe what should be left out of it.
Looks like to start off it has uh three
questions for me to to think through and
give some answers on. And by the way,
this clarifying questions, this Q&A
interface, this wasn't in cloud code
originally earlier in the year last
year. And so that was a key part of what
agent OS provided since day one, a way
to have the agent interview you to
really shape the spec before it locks in
the plan and before it starts building.
But now, as you can see, that Q&A
interface and the ability to think
through and prepare really helpful,
constructive clarifying questions. All
of that now is a first class feature of
both Claude Code and the Opus 4.5 model.
So I'm going to read through these
questions and give them some thought and
I'll give some answers. It's even
suggesting a couple different uh
charting libraries and it recommends one
over the others. All right. So now based
on my answers and uh based on its
continued analysis of my codebase and
our product, it's going to formulate a
plan and then present it to me to
review. So I'm going to let it cook on
that for a minute. And by the way, this
is specd driven development. It's now a
firstass workflow built right into cloud
code. something that um you know I
really think is essential for any
professional builders in back in 2025
but also here in 2026. And by specri
development I mean you know really
emphasizing the effort and the thought
and the craft that goes into the
planning phase uh before we have the
agent go off and actually build. It
really makes a big difference in the
level of quality and success rate that
that we can have at the end of the
process. Okay, looks like its plan is
ready for me to review. So I'm actually
going to read this in detail and uh and
see if I agree with everything that it's
including in the scope and its
implementation plan. All right. So it's
mostly good, but I do have a couple of
notes uh to try to simplify the scope a
little bit before we get going. So I am
going to scroll down and instead of uh
saying yes, go ahead and build, I'm
going to go to the third option here and
type some feedback to have Claude update
the plan on the gem insights. Let's just
focus on tracking number of gems per
stream. When it comes to filtering,
let's keep it simple and just include
the ability to filter by stream. And so,
you know, I'm working my experience into
this knowing that like there are some
aspects of this that could be a little
bit more complex. I'm sure Claude Opus
4.5 could probably handle it just fine,
but I I do want to keep the feature
somewhat simple. No need to bloat the
codebase unnecessarily. So Claude is
going to go ahead and simplify the the
plan with my feedback. Okay, so the plan
has been updated pretty quickly and
yeah, it all looks good. So I'm going to
go ahead and uh give Claude the go ahead
to uh bypass asking me for permissions
for every little thing and it's going to
go ahead and start building. So Claude's
getting to work and it created a to-do
list for itself. Again, that's something
that agent OS used to do as well. it
would break a speck out into a task
list. But now that's just sort of built
into the way that claude code works by
taking a plan or a spec and breaking it
out into tasks that it can track over a
long period of time. So we're going to
let this work for a while and then we'll
come back to it. So what changed here in
2026? Well, two things converged. First,
the models got dramatically better. Opus
4.5 specifically, but also Gemini 3 and
GPT5. Now that we're a few months into
working with these frontier models, it's
clear now that we're truly at a turning
point, both in terms of what the models
are capable of and an observable
increase in adoption. The models
understand our intent better, and they
maintain context more reliably across
really long sessions. And they execute
complex multifile changes with
significantly fewer mistakes. the back
and forth cycles where you're constantly
fixing and reprompting and redoing
things, those have dropped way down. Not
to zero, but enough that the workflow
feels fundamentally different now. And
second, cloud code itself evolved. Plan
mode overall is polished and reliable
now for powering a specdriven
development approach and features like
skills and sub aents give you targeted
capabilities without the framework
overhead. So the bottom line is much of
what we built scaffolding for back in
2025 is now just part of claude code.
Okay, so uh Claude is all finished with
its work. So let's uh let's see how we
did. All right, so I see it added the
new trends view here in the navigation.
Yeah, I see a functional trends view
with uh with some graphs, but there are
some front-end UI issues that I think
we're going to need to smooth out. Uh so
I will need to give it a bit of feedback
to fix some of these. And I think part
of the reason why I'm seeing this is
because I initially forgot to invoke the
front-end design skill, which I have in
my system, but forgot to include that in
the in the plan. And then I inserted it
into Claude's work uh midway through. So
you can see here I said be sure to use
the front-end design skill when
designing new UI interfaces for this
feature. So that was my mistake. I
should have done that earlier before
Cloud even began its work. And so I
think that like inserting that midway
through might have uh thrown it off a
little bit and resulted in a little bit
of inconsistency here. But this looks
like uh the kinds of things that I think
we can uh probably smooth out with a bit
of feedback.
All right. So I pointed out a few UI
issues and I provided uh several
screenshots along with those. So let's
have Claude uh work on those fixes.
All right. So, uh, it took a few minutes
to fix, uh, those UI issues. Let's, uh,
restart the server and see how we're
doing. Okay. Yeah, this is much better.
Yeah, it's totally in line and
consistent with the other pages. So,
those layout issues are fixed, and it's
now using the consistent card style that
we've already established in the app.
And let's see how we're doing on mobile.
Looks great. And, uh, everything in the
app is dark mode, including this trends
view. So, this is perfect. I would say
this is uh pretty close to a shippable
state. Now, let me show you a couple of
core features in cloud code that really
matter when you're doing professional
work like this. Cloud skills are
becoming an essential tool. Now, you can
still do a lot without them, but when
you need specialized workflows or
capabilities, Claude skills really help
you up your game. For example, I just
invoked the front-end design skill to
build this trends feature. The Claude
team actually created that one and it
adds some design muscle to the front-end
design process. Another one is context
management. You can always pull up older
sessions to pick up where you left off
or rewind if your context gets off
track. Small power features like this in
Cloud Code really make a big difference
in productivity. Now, I want to be clear
about something. When I say that Cloud
Code handles 90% of the work, I don't
mean that I just type a prompt and magic
happens. Our experience as builders
matters more than ever. It's just
applied differently. The models can
implement any pattern we describe, but
they can't choose which pattern is
right. They can't understand your users.
They can't make strategic calls about
what to build and why. Product thinking
and knowing how to formulate real
solutions for real people. Understanding
the difference between what a customer
says that they want and what they
actually need. That's the craft now. And
honestly, that skill will never be
obsolete. It's something that we should
always be working to improve. There's
always another level, especially now.
The bottleneck isn't writing code
anymore. It's knowing what to build and
how to structure it. And that's where
our experience becomes our multiplier.
And so when I say that cloud code is all
you need, I mean that the tooling is all
you need. But your judgment, your taste,
your product instincts, that's what
makes it work. Now, I said that cloud
code and nothing else could handle 90%
of the work. But what about the other
10%. Well, there are still some
scenarios where some additional
structure could help. One is green field
product design. So when you're starting
from zero and you need to establish a
design system and UI patterns and an
architecture before you have a codebase
to work in and that's actually why I
created design OS. Yeah. And sure that's
a free frameworky thing but really it
just gives you a structured process for
using cloud code in the design phase
before the actual building begins.
Another scenario is when you're working
with legacy code bases where you have
established conventions and having those
standards documented and then easily
referenced by agents can help bring
those projects into today's AI first
workflow. And that's an area where I
think agent OS could actually help. But
here's the important takeaway. You
should notice when you need something
more than just claw code because you'll
feel that friction. The mistake is
assuming that you need extra tooling
before you allow yourself the
opportunity to be productive using just
cloud code and nothing else. So whether
you're just starting to use cloud code
or you've been deep in frameworks and
custom setups, the path in 2026 is the
same. Start with pure cloud code, learn
the native features, but more
importantly your workflow. Only add
complexity when you actually need it.
Now, I mentioned Agent OS, and I built
it to solve real problems that we felt
back in 2025, but looking at it now in
this landscape, I'm rethinking what, if
anything, I actually want out of a
utility framework like Agent OS. And so,
if you've been layering tools and
frameworks on top of your cloud code
workflow, then I want you to see my next
video. I'm going to show you exactly how
I'm stripping away the unnecessary bloat
and getting back to what actually
matters. It's about subtraction, not
addition, without losing touch with what
makes our craft of building software
unique. So, if you haven't yet, hit

And I'll see you over there next. Let's
keep building in 2026.
