## Pattern Analysis

### What's working (high views/sub ratio)

**1. Credential Authority — "How I [verb] (Credential)"**
- John Kim's "How I use Claude Code (Meta Staff Engineer Tips)" = **8.7x** views/sub ratio
- The parenthetical credential is doing massive work — it signals insider knowledge
- This is the #1 outlier pattern in the entire dataset

**2. "His/Their [Workflow] Is Insane" — Third-Person Reaction**
- "His Claude Code Workflow Is Insane" = 1.3x (John Kim, 21k on 16.5K subs, only 20 hours old)
- Creates curiosity about whose workflow and why it's special
- Feels like a recommendation rather than self-promotion

**3. Emotional Adjectives + Numbers**
- "10 Crazy Ways To Get An Unfair Advantage" — 22k on 122K subs
- "8 Insane Claude Code Use Cases (code anything!)" — 22k on 59.2K subs (0.37x)
- "10 Claude Code tips I wish I knew from the start" — 16k on 38.2K subs (0.42x)
- Numbers + emotional words outperform plain number lists

**4. "You're Using X Wrong" — Negative Hook**
- "You're using Claude Code Wrong - These 10 Tips Will Change Everything" — 15k on 40.4K subs (0.37x)
- Challenges the viewer's competence, creates urgency to watch

**5. Time-Constrained Titles**
- "Claude Code Worktrees in 7 Minutes" — 19k on 57.9K subs (0.33x)
- "How to Use Claude Code Agent Teams in 13 Mins" — 26k on 40.4K subs (0.64x)

**6. "10x Your Productivity" — Bold Outcome Claims**
- "Claude Code Workflows That Will 10x Your Productivity" — 21k on 16.5K subs (1.3x)
- Specific multiplier claims work when attached to workflows

### What's NOT working

**"Just Changed EVERYTHING" with ALL CAPS**
- "Claude Code's NEW Plan Mode Just Changed EVERYTHING" — 7k on **148K subs** (0.05x ratio)
- This formula feels overdone and clickbaity now — viewers are tuning it out

**"Nobody's Talking About" curiosity gap**
- "The AI Workflow Nobody's Talking About" — 4.5k on 22.9K subs (0.20x)
- Underperforming in this niche — maybe too vague

**"The BEST FEATURE of Claude Code is..."**
- AICodeKing's title with incomplete sentence — 22k on 124K subs (0.18x)
- Trailing ellipsis/cliffhanger not pulling its weight for the channel size

## New Title Hypotheses to A/B Test

### High Priority (strong competitive evidence)

1. **Credential authority** — "How I Use Claude Code (as a [credential])"
   - John Kim proved this at 8.7x views/sub ratio
   - Ray could test: credential in parentheses vs without

2. **"You're Using It Wrong"** — "You're Using Claude Code Wrong — Here's What to Do Instead"
   - Negative hook not yet tested in Ray's A/B tests
   - Could combine with number: "You're Using Claude Code Wrong — 5 Things to Fix Now"

3. **Emotional number lists** — "10 Insane Claude Code Features You're Not Using"
   - Combines Ray's proven "number" formula with emotional adjectives from competitors
   - Tests if "Insane/Crazy" adjectives boost the existing winning formula

4. **Third-person reaction** — "His Claude Code Setup Is Insane"
   - Tests reaction format (works well for John Kim)
   - Could pair with a collab or featured developer

### Medium Priority

5. **Time-constrained** — "Claude Code [Feature] in [N] Minutes"
   - Good for single-feature deep dives
   - Signals quick value

6. **"I wish I knew"** — "10 Claude Code Features I Wish I Knew From Day One"
   - Nostalgia/regret hook — tested well for No Code MBA (0.42x)

7. **"Unfair advantage"** — "How Claude Code Gives You an Unfair Coding Advantage"
   - Competitive/edge framing that worked for AI LABS

8. **Bold outcome claims** — "Claude Code Workflows That Will 10x Your Productivity"
   - Specific multiplier claims with workflow focus

### Lower Priority (less evidence)

9. **"The Only [Thing] You Need"** — definitive/exclusive framing
10. **"You Can Now" framing** — second-person capability
11. **Problem framing** — "Your CLAUDE.md File Is Probably Hurting Your Code"
