# Socials

Ray's social media content, research, and performance data.

## Structure

Each platform folder follows the same pattern:

```
socials/
├── youtube/
│   ├── ab-tests/       — Title & thumbnail A/B test results
│   ├── analysis/       — Competitor content analysis (hooks, structure, patterns)
│   ├── self-audit/     — Ray's own content audited against research
│   └── transcripts/    — Downloaded transcripts organized by channel
└── linkedin/
    ├── analysis/       — Feed analysis and viral post research
    └── posts/          — Post drafts, history, and performance tracking
```

## Conventions

- **analysis/** — Always research about *other* creators/posts. Organized by date: `YYYY-MM-*.md`
- **self-audit/** or **posts/** — Ray's own content and performance data
- **ab-tests/** — Platform-specific testing results (YouTube only for now)
- **transcripts/** — Raw content organized by creator subfolder (YouTube only)
- Date prefix files as `YYYY-MM-` for chronological sorting
