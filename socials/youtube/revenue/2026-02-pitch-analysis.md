### What You Said vs What It Earned

---

**Video 1 — Jan 2 — $5,246 gross / 86 sales / $61 avg / peak: 42 sales on day 2**

Opening:
> "This video is sponsored by myself and my Claude Code masterclass. It is the most comprehensive Cloud Code class you will find on the internet right now. And there will be a link down below alongside a coupon code because there's a New Year's sale going on right now. So you will be able to get it cheaper and I do update the class regularly with any new features."

Closing:
> "...most comprehensive class on Claude Code on the entire internet and you can search online and check."

Tactics: Self-sponsor framing (new), superlative, New Year sale urgency, discount framing ("get it cheaper"), content freshness, verification challenge ("search online and check"). 4 CTAs.

Revenue shape: Upload day only $979 (15 sales) — **day 2 exploded to $2,605 (42 sales)**. People thought about it overnight. Weak urgency = slow conversion.

---

**Video 2 — Jan 8 — $11,288 gross / 168 sales / $67 avg / peak: 98 sales on day 2**

Opening:
> "This video is sponsored by myself and my Claude Code Masterclass. There is a new year sale going on right now... it's basically the most comprehensive class on Claude Code that you will find on the internet. Many people have taken the class and gone on to be the best Claude Code users at their company, so you may also find it helpful."

Mid-video (tied to hooks feature):
> "I'll now be updating my Claude Code Masterclass with a lot of information that I briefly mentioned, but in more detail."

Tactics: Self-sponsor, New Year sale, superlative, **first outcome-based social proof ("best at their company")**, content freshness tied to feature just shown. 4 CTAs.

Revenue shape: Upload day $3,492 (53 sales), then **day 2 hit $6,428 with 98 sales — the single biggest sales day in the dataset.** Social proof + sale created word-of-mouth overnight.

**What changed from Video 1 → 2:** Added "many people have taken the class and gone on to be the best Claude Code users at their company." That one line of social proof correlates with revenue jumping $5,246 → $11,288 (+115%).

---

**Video 3 — Jan 19 — $16,603 gross / 130 sales / $128 avg / peak: 73 sales on day 1 — HIGHEST REVENUE**

Opening:
> "This video is sponsored by myself and my Claude Code Masterclass. It is the most comprehensive class on Claude Code that you will find online. And nowadays many companies are paying a premium for being able to use Claude Code effectively and build natively with it. The new year sale is almost over and it will get more expensive over time, so it's better to lock in the price now."

Mid-video (tied to specific hook):
> "If you are interested in this hook and workflow to automatically review plans with other CLI tools, then you can either create the hook yourself or join my Claude Code Masterclass where you can download it."

Closing:
> "...the new year sale will be ending soon and over time the prices will become more expensive as I continue to add more videos and features. So if you sign up now you can lock it in at the current price."

Tactics: Self-sponsor, superlative, **market demand framing ("companies paying a premium")**, **triple urgency — sale ending + permanent price escalation + price lock**, mid-video CTA offers a **concrete deliverable ("you can download it")**. 4 CTAs.

Revenue shape: **$9,552 on upload day alone (73 sales)** — the only video where day 1 is the biggest day. Strong urgency eliminated the "I'll think about it" delay. Days 2–3 still pulled $3,740 and $3,311. Price also jumped ~$60 → ~$122, so each sale was worth 2x.

**What changed from Video 2 → 3:**
1. Added "companies are paying a premium" (market-level social proof replacing individual)
2. Added "it will get more expensive over time" (**permanent** price escalation — not just "sale ends")
3. Added "lock in the price now" (price lock framing)
4. Mid-video CTA offered a downloadable deliverable instead of vague "I cover this in more detail"

**This is the only video that tells viewers the price will go up permanently.** Revenue: +47% over the next best video.

---

**Video 4 — Jan 23 — $5,649 gross / 40 sales / $141 avg / peak: 18 sales on day 3**

Opening:
> "If you want to join hundreds of other people and become the most proficient Claude Code user at your company, through the most comprehensive Claude Code class that you will find online, then there will be a link down below."

Only other CTA (mid-video):
> "If any more ideas come to mind, then I will be sharing them in my Claude Code masterclass. There's a link down below."

Tactics: Social proof ("hundreds of people"), aspiration ("most proficient at your company"). **No urgency. No pricing. No self-sponsor framing. Only 2 CTAs — softest pitch of any video.**

Revenue shape: Only 9 sales on upload day ($1,090). Slow build to 18 on day 3 ($2,682). **Upload-day revenue was 88% lower than the previous video's upload day.** Also only 4 days after the Jan 19 monster — audience may have been tapped.

**What changed from Video 3 → 4:**
1. Dropped self-sponsor framing
2. Dropped all urgency (sale ending, price lock, escalation)
3. Replaced market-level proof with weaker "hundreds of people"
4. Dropped the downloadable deliverable CTA
5. Cut from 4 CTAs to 2

Revenue dropped $16,603 → $5,649 (**−66%**).

---

**Video 5 — Feb 6 — $6,501 gross / 41 sales / $159 avg / peak: 19 sales on day 1**

Opening:
> "I have a brand new class in my Claude Code masterclass all about advanced context engineering. It is probably the most comprehensive class you will find on using context engineering with Claude Code and the masterclass does include 150 lessons. A lot of people are now realizing that mastering Claude Code is the highest leverage skill that you can have this year and my class teaches you how to do exactly that. There is a small sale going on right now."

Closing:
> "I will be updating my cloud code master class with any of the new things that have been added... you can learn many of the ideas in the brand new advanced context engineering class."

Tactics: **New product announcement** (advanced context engineering class), "150 lessons" quantity signal, market trend framing ("highest leverage skill this year"), understated "small sale", content freshness. 4 CTAs.

Revenue shape: Steady — 19 sales day 1, 14 day 2, 8 day 3. No explosive spike. Base price jumped to ~$169 here.

**What changed from Video 4 → 5:** Brought back 4 CTAs, added new product announcement, market trend framing, quantity proof ("150 lessons"), mild urgency ("small sale"). Revenue recovered $5,649 → $6,501 but didn't approach Jan levels.

---

**Video 6 — Feb 15 — $3,806 gross / 20 sales / $190 avg / peak: 9 sales on day 3**

Note: This video ("The Highest Point of Leverage in Claude Code") doesn't have a transcript on file. Revenue data only.

Revenue shape: Weakest upload day — only 6 sales ($810). Slow build to 9 on day 3. At ~$219, each sale counts more but volume was very low.

---

**Video 7 — Feb 21 — $4,584 gross / 25 sales / $183 avg / peak: 9 sales on day 2**

Opening:
> "If you want to sign up to my brand new free Claude Code newsletter, then that will be linked down below. You will get access to a bunch of free videos as well about how I'm currently using Claude Code and some of my own workflows."

Mid-video (masterclass used as live demo):
> "My Claude Code Masterclass, if I copy the URL, paste into Claude Code and say, 'Can you tell me why this is the best Claude Code Masterclass on the internet right now?'"

Closing:
> "Many people have taken the class and have gone on to be the best Claude Code users at their company and have even gotten promoted because of their newly learned Claude Code skills. Many of the biggest companies in the world are already using Claude Code and expecting proficiency in Claude Code to be a given like nowadays... if you want to buy the class for your team as well, there will be another page for that. And you can also book a call as well to like discuss any requirements."

Tactics: **Newsletter leads opening for the first time** (masterclass buried mid-video). Closing has the strongest social proof yet ("gotten promoted") + market pressure ("companies expecting proficiency to be a given") + new team purchase CTA + sales call CTA. 5 CTAs — most of any video, but paid product is buried.

Revenue shape: Only 8 sales on upload day ($1,671). Flat across 3 days (8, 9, 8). **The strongest social proof and most CTAs produced one of the weakest windows.** The free newsletter leading likely absorbed the action impulse.

**What changed from Video 5 → 7:**
1. Newsletter moved to pole position (masterclass demoted)
2. Strongest social proof ("gotten promoted") but buried at end behind newsletter
3. Added team CTA and sales call — may have diluted the core CTA
Revenue: $6,501 → $4,584 (**−29%** despite more CTAs and stronger proof).

---

**Video 8 — Feb 25 — $5,176 gross / 32 sales / $162 avg / peak: 14 sales on day 2**

No opening CTA. First pitch is a passing mid-video reference:
> "I've covered that before in my Claude Code Masterclass. But that was like kind of a hassle to do."

Closing (newsletter only):
> "If you do want to get my own thoughts about it and ways in which I'm using it, then you can sign up to my newsletter, which will be linked down below. You do get access to a bunch of bonus free videos as well that you won't find here on the YouTube channel."

Tactics: **No masterclass hard sell anywhere.** Newsletter is the only real CTA. Exclusivity on free content ("won't find here on YouTube"). 3 CTAs but 2 are passing references.

Revenue shape: 9 sales upload day ($1,443), 14 on day 2 ($2,110). No spike. This is the $219 price point performing at its natural rate with zero urgency.

### Revenue Spike Shape by Pitch Type

| Video | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Shape | What the pitch did |
|-------|------:|------:|------:|-------|--------------------|
| Jan 2 | $979 | $2,605 | $1,662 | Slow build | Urgency present but mild — "sale going on" |
| Jan 8 | $3,492 | **$6,428** | $1,368 | Day 2 explosion | Social proof + sale drove word-of-mouth overnight |
| Jan 19 | **$9,552** | $3,740 | $3,311 | **Day 1 frontloaded** | Permanent price escalation = buy NOW impulse |
| Jan 23 | $1,090 | $1,877 | $2,682 | Inverted (day 3) | No urgency = no impulse, people waited |
| Feb 6 | $2,788 | $2,517 | $1,195 | Even decay | Mild "small sale" — steady but no spike |
| Feb 21 | $1,671 | $1,607 | $1,307 | Flat | Newsletter-first absorbed the action impulse |
| Feb 25 | $1,443 | $2,110 | $1,623 | Flat | No hard CTA at all |

**Only the Jan 19 pitch was strong enough to make people buy immediately.** Every other video peaks on day 2 or 3. The difference: "it will get more expensive over time, so it's better to lock in the price now."

---

### Actionable Takeaways

1. **Bring back price escalation framing** — "I'm adding X new lessons next month and the price will go up" earned 2.2x more than temporary "sale" framing. It works best when the price actually is going up
2. **Don't lead with newsletter** — masterclass-first openings earned 85% more ($9,057 vs $4,880 avg). Keep newsletter as an end CTA
3. **Put social proof in the opening, not closing** — "companies are paying a premium" in the opening → $16,603. "Gotten promoted" in the closing → $4,584. Same quality proof, 3.6x difference based on placement
4. **Bring back "sponsored by myself"** — videos with it: $9,697 avg. Without: $5,017 avg. It makes the pitch feel like a natural segment
5. **Offer concrete deliverables mid-video** — "you can download this hook" may convert better than "I cover this in more detail"
6. **Announce the next price increase in advance** — the Jan 19 video worked because the price actually was going up. If you're planning another increase, announce it a video before it happens
