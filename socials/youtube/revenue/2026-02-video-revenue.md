### Observations

**Top 3 revenue windows (net):**
1. **$16,161** — Anthropic Just Added These Features (Jan 19) — 130 sales
2. **$11,028** — Claude Code's Biggest Update in Months (Jan 8) — 168 sales
3. **$6,332** — Learn Claude Code Agent Teams in 12 Minutes (Feb 6) — 41 sales

**The Jan 19 spike explained:** This was the first video after the price jumped from ~$60 → ~$122. The combination of 130 sales at the new price created the biggest revenue window. The Jan 8 video had more sales (168) but at the old ~$60 price — so roughly half the revenue per sale.

**Price increases haven't killed volume as much as expected:** Going from ~$60 to ~$219 (3.6x price increase over ~2 months), sales per window dropped from 86–168 down to 20–41. Revenue per window actually held steady or grew in absolute terms despite fewer sales — suggesting the audience has price tolerance and the product was underpriced early on.

**Revenue per view standout:** The Jan 19 video ($0.82/view) generated 4x more revenue per view than Jan 8 ($0.45/view) and 10x more than the Dec videos (~$0.09/view). Most of this is explained by the price increase rather than better conversion.

**Dec videos were cheapest *and* lowest volume:** Only 30–44 sales at ~$39–59. This was likely early channel growth before the audience compounded.
