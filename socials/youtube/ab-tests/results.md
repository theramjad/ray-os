## Master Summary: Winning Patterns

### Title Formulas Ranked by Reliability

| Formula | Avg Performance | Best For |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| "Anthropic Just Dropped [number] New [Tool] Features" | ~37% | Multi-feature updates (with count) |
| "Anthropic Just Added [specific feature] to Claude Code" | ~35-42% | Multi-feature updates |
| "Anthropic Just [verb] [thing]" (Dropped, Revealed, Connected) | ~36-42% | Major announcements |
| "[Tool]'s Biggest Update in [timeframe]" | ~37% | Major releases |
| "My [specific tool] [Workflow/Process] for [year]" | ~36% | Personal/opinion content |
| "[Tool]'s New [Feature] Explained" | ~30-33% | Educational (underperforms) |

### Thumbnail Text Formulas Ranked

| Formula | Performance | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| "How I [Verb] Now" | **51.5%** | Dominant winner |
| "[Feature] Changed" | ~35% | Good, short |
| "[Feature] + Magnitude" | ~32% | Medium |
| "How [Feature] Works Now" | ~32% | Medium (less personal) |

### Key Rules

**Titles:**
1. "Anthropic" authority framing is reliable but not unbeatable
2. "Dropped" > "Added" > "Changed" — casual hype > newness > improvement
3. Specific numbers ("10 New") boost engagement over vague "These Features"
4. Shorter, cleaner titles generally win
5. Listing multiple features in the title kills performance
6. "Explained" educational framing consistently underperforms
7. Catchy terminology ("Swarms") beats technical ("Multi-Agent Teams")
8. Specific tool names beat generic terms ("Claude Code" > "AI Coding")
9. Pipe format ("| Here's What Changed") underperforms — avoid

**Thumbnails:**
1. "How I [X] Now" is the dominant formula
2. Shorter is better (2-3 words ideal)
3. Present tense "Now" beats year references
4. Personal framing ("How I") beats feature framing ("How [Feature]")
5. Simple past tense works ("Changed", "Dropped")

## Video 10: Claude Code Remote Control Feature

**Video ID:** `y3xzYwxQuHc`
**Final Title Selected:** "Anthropic Just Dropped Remote Control for Claude Code"

### Title A/B Test Round 1 (title-only, same thumbnail across all)

| Title | Thumbnail Text | Watch-time Share | Result |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| **Anthropic Just Dropped Remote Control for Claude Code** | My New Workflow | **40.4%** | ✅ WINNER |
| Anthropic Just Turned Your Phone Into a Coding Terminal | My New Workflow | 31.7% | |
| You Can Now Control Claude Code From Anywhere | My New Workflow | 27.9% | |

### Title A/B Test Round 2 (title-only, same thumbnail across all)

| Title | Thumbnail Text | Watch-time Share | Result |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| **Anthropic Just Dropped Remote Control for Claude Code** | My New Workflow | **40.9%** | ✅ WINNER |
| Anthropic Just Made Claude Code Work From Anywhere | My New Workflow | 33.8% | |
| I Control Claude Code From My Phone Now | My New Workflow | 25.4% | |

### Title A/B Test Round 3 (title-only, same thumbnail across all)

| Title | Thumbnail Text | Watch-time Share | Result |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| **Anthropic Just Dropped the Feature Everyone Asked For** | My New Workflow | **38.1%** | Leading |
| Anthropic Just Dropped Remote Control for Claude Code | My New Workflow | 31.1% | |
| Anthropic Just Dropped Phone Control for Claude Code | My New Workflow | 30.8% | |

**Key Learnings (across all 3 rounds):**
- Social proof + curiosity ("the Feature Everyone Asked For") beats specific feature naming — major finding that overturns round 1-2 conclusions
- "Remote Control" vs "Phone Control" essentially tied (31.1% vs 30.8%) — specific wording within the same concept doesn't matter
- The previous 40%+ scores for "Remote Control" may have been inflated by weak competitors (questions, personal framing) rather than the feature name being strong
- "Dropped" remains the best verb — all 3 variants used it, so the variable here was specificity vs curiosity
- "Anthropic Just Dropped" + social proof/curiosity is the new strongest formula
- Personal "I [verb]... Now" framing flopped hard in titles (25.4%) — works in thumbnails, not titles
- Dropping Anthropic authority is a death sentence for titles (25.4% without vs 40.9% with)
- "My New Workflow" thumbnail text consistent across all rounds

## Tests Still Worth Running

1. **Bold/emotional claims** — "This Changes Everything" type titles
2. ~~**"You Can Now" framing**~~ **TESTED (Video 10)** — Flopped at 27.9%. Second-person capability framing doesn't work.
3. ~~**Question format titles**~~ **TESTED (Video 10 earlier test)** — Question format underperforms statement format by ~2-5%.
4. **Problem framing** — "Your CLAUDE.md File Is Probably Hurting Your Code"
5. **"Why" framing** — "Why Most CLAUDE.md Files Make Claude Code Worse"
6. **Transformative framing** — "Turned X Into Y" tested at 31.7% (Video 10) — decent, worth retesting in a stronger position
