The Claude code team just shipped a new
playground plug-in and essentially gives
us a whole new way to interact with
Claude. [music]
Instead of typing instructions, Claude
can now build you an interactive tool.
[music] Sliders, click regions, approve
reject buttons tailored to whatever
you're working on. You interact with it
visually and the playground generates
new instructions to Claude for you.
Claude builds the interface. You give
feedback through it. Let me show you how
it works. [music]
Hey, Alex here from Grit AI Studio.
Today we're looking at the Playground
plug-in, one of the official plugins
from Anthropics curated marketplace.
This one is different from most plugins.
It doesn't add a slash command or an MCP
server. It teaches Claude a new skill,
the ability to generate self-contained
interactive HTML playgrounds. Single
file apps that open in your browser with
controls on one side, live preview on
the other, and a prompt output at the
bottom that you can copy back into
Claude. Think of it as an on the-fly
artifact built by Claude, but running
locally, fully self-contained, and
designed specifically for exploration,
feedback, and configuration. Or you can
think of it this way. Claude builds
custom interfaces to capture your
feedback, visual tools that translate
your interactions back into precise
instructions. Let me show you how to
install it, and then we'll build a few
things live.
Installation is straightforward. The
playground plugin is in Anthropic's
official marketplace which is already
available in Cloud Code by default. So
you just run /plugin and then search for
it
or you can run this command. You might
need to restart Claude after you've
installed it. And that's it. No
marketplace to add first. The official
one is preconfigured. So, this is a
skill-based plug-in, which means that
Claude automatically knows when to use
it based on your request. You can ask
for a playground, an interactive
explorer, or a visual tool for
something, and Claude picks up the
skill. Let me show you what that looks
like in practice.
So, before we demo, let me explain the
architecture really quickly. Every
playground Claude generates follows the
same pattern. One, it builds a single
HTML file. All CSS and JavaScript is
inlined. There's no external
dependencies, no CDN links, no build
step, just one file that you can open,
share, or save. Two, every playground
has this three panel layout. There's an
interactive control on one side with
sliders, drop downs, color pickers,
toggles, you name it. And then there's a
live preview on the other side that
updates instantly as you change
anything. And then finally, there's a
prompt output panel at the bottom. Yeah.
So three, the prompt output. That's
really a key part of this innovation.
It's not a value dump. It generates
natural language instructions that you
can copy back into Claude and it only
mentions what you changed from the
defaults. Claude built the interface to
understand what you want. Now it speaks
it back.
The plug-in ships with six templates out
of the box. the design playground, the
data explorer, a concept map, there's a
document critique, then you have the
diff view, and there's a code map. So,
let's try a few of these out. Could you
explain our codebase with a code map
playground where I can ask questions
about specific parts of our code?
Now, you can explore and ask questions
to dig deeper. Select one of the nodes
and say I don't fully understand this
one. [music]
Here's another example. I want to
optimize our claude MD file, but I'm
scared of removing useful stuff. Could
you review it and then use the document
critique playground highlighting all
suggestions so that I can approve,
reject, or make comments before we
actually update the file? Or you can
just ask it to give you inline
suggestions that you can approve,
reject, or comment.
Claude will try to use the templates,
but if you ask for something a bit
outside of these, it will go off and
create custom playgrounds for us, which
opens up some really cool use cases. I
guess the original idea was to use
playgrounds to feed back to CLA, but it
clearly has a ton of different use
cases. I see a lot of people are using
playgrounds to create their own
interactive learning experiences.
Let's try out another one. We've applied
quite a few database migrations recently
and I'm getting a bit lost here. Could
you use the data explorer playground to
help me navigate some of our data?
[music]
A lot of clever people have already come
up with some really cool examples on X.
Someone even built a way to send the
feedback straight back to Claude using a
neat little MCP trick. Essentially
removing the need to copy and paste. In
particular, I love this one for image
generation feedback loops. essentially
allowing you to pass precise annotations
back to Nana Banana as it improves the
images.
Or this one here where they built an
animation playground allowing her to
explore all sorts of interactions.
Really cool.
Okay, let's try making our own custom
playground. Let's start with something
that I feel shows off one key use case
for the playground plug-in visual
feedback. Create an image annotation
playground. I'll paste in a screenshot
of my apps dashboard. I want to click on
areas, draw rectangles around problems,
and add feedback comments to each
region. Watch what Claude does. It's
generating a complete annotation tool.
canvas for the image, drawing tools, a
comment panel, and it's all in a single
HTML file. And here it is. I've loaded a
screenshot of a dashboard that I'm
working on. Let me walk through the
interface. So, here we have the main
canvas, the image with an overlay for
drawing. I can click and drag and draw
rectangles around any region. On the
sidebar, we see a list of the
annotations. Each one shows the region
that I selected and has a text field for
my feedback. And then down here at the
bottom, we have the prompt output panel,
which you'll recognize in every
playground. Let me draw a box around
this icon here and type let's upgrade
these icons to something more
interesting. Now, I'll mark this here.
Add a mouse over showing the actual
tools here. Okay, watch the prompt
output. It structures all of my feedback
annotated with the position on the
screen organized like an actual
instruction that we can now copy and
paste back into Claude or add it to a
GitHub issue if we prefer that. I didn't
describe where anything was. I pointed
at it. You can of course combine this
with voice as well. And you can expand
and add more functionality to your
playground. The playground captured my
feedback and translated it into
locationare instructions. Of course,
this is a bit of a simplified example,
but yeah, you could actually build
anything with the help of Claude and
playgrounds. So, Claude actually built
me an interface to give feedback that I
couldn't easily give just through words.
I pointed, I commented, and the
playground translated that into a prompt
that Claude can act on. This pairs
beautifully with image generation like
we saw in the nana banana example. But
this way of working applies to so many
things. Generate a mockup, load it into
an annotation playground, point at what
needs to change, copy the prompt back,
visual output, visual feedback, and a
refined prompt. The cool thing now is
that we can give feedback and ask for
more features in our playground. Tweak
it and tune it. And once we're happy
with it, we simply ask Claude to turn
this into a reusable playground scale
for us.
[music]
Okay, let's try one last build. I think
this one is very cool as it's quite
unexpected. Create a concept map
playground for understanding the Claude
code plug-in system. include concepts
like plugins, skills, agents, hooks, MCB
servers, marketplaces, and how they
relate to each other. Do proper research
in the official docs before you build
the playground.
This uses the concept map template and
it's built on a canvas element with
actual physics simulation. The canvas
area here shows nodes that you can drag
around connected by labeled edges
showing relationships. Plugins contain
skills. Skills uses skill files, hooks,
trigger, tool use, and so on. On the
sidebar, each concept has a knowledge
level toggle that cycles through three
states. The green one, no, I understand
this. Amber, fussy, I've heard about it,
but I'm not confident. Red one, unknown.
This is new to me. Now, let me drag
these around to organize them. Let's
mark plugins and skills. We know those
hooks. Okay, let's put that as unknown.
Now, look at the prompt output. Now, we
have a targeted learning prompt. Instead
of saying, explain the plug-in system
and getting generic overview, you've
told Claude exactly what you know, what
you're shaky on, and what's brand new.
The response you get back is going to be
far more useful. There's nothing
stopping you from also asking it to
create an interactive learning
playground on the back of that feedback.
I guess it's fair to say that this isn't
a prompt helper. It's a knowledge state
capture tool. You're telling Claude
exactly where you are and it generates a
prompt that meets you there. There are
so many use cases you can apply to
something like this, such as scope
mapping a new project, decomposing
tasks, mapping out API surfaces you need
to learn, and so on. If you're lost for
inspiration, just ask Claude, "What are
10 brilliant playgrounds we could build
together?
I briefly mentioned the six templates
already, but let me walk you through
them quickly. The design playground
provides sliders for UI component
configuration, spacing, color,
typography, shadows. is great for
exploring design direction quickly
without describing them all in words.
The data explorer makes it easy to build
queries for SQL APIs, reg x pipelines
and so on. You construct queries
visually and it generates the
specification for you. Then you have the
document critique template. Here you can
paste in a document and get a review
interface with line by line suggestions
like we used for the claude MD file.
Each suggestion gets approved, reject,
or comment buttons, and the prompt
output only includes your approved
suggestions and comments. It's great for
reviewing specs, readme files, or skill
files or cloud MD files. Then we have
the diff review template. It's the same
idea, but for code diffs. It renders a
proper diff view with green red line
highlighting and you can add inline
comments on any line, outputs a
structured code review prompt. It's
really useful for reviewing commits or
pull requests visually before writing
feedback. Then finally, there's a code
map template. This is an SVG based
architecture diagram. Nodes represent
components with file paths. Edges show
relationships like data flow, tool
calls, and dependencies. You click
components to add annotations. The
prompt output includes your comments
with full context. Think of it as a
visual way to annotate and discuss
architecture. All six follow the same
core pattern. Controls, live preview,
prompt output, and a copy button.
A few things that I've learned using
this plugin so far. One, you can
customize any playground after it's
generated. It's just an HTML file. If
you want to add more controls, tweak the
layout, or change the dark theme, just
ask Claude to modify the file. And a pro
tip is you can also combine it with the
front-end design skill to make it even
more awesome. Two, presets are your
friend. Where relevant, playground
typically generates three to five named
presets. If not, you can ask for it
explicitly. Start by clicking through
those before you touch individual
controls. Often one preset gets you 80%
there. Number three, the prompt output
is designed to be context complete. You
can paste it into a completely different
cloud session and it should make sense.
Four, the concept map template uses
force directed layout, a physics
simulation. You can hit the auto layout
button if your nodes get tangled up. It
will snap them back into a readable
arrangement. Five, if none of the six
templates fit your use case exactly,
just ask Claude to create a playground
anyway. The skill will pick the closest
template and adapt. Six playgrounds work
beautifully with visual outputs from
other tools like the Nana Banana
example. Think about what that unlocks.
Visual feedback on visual output. All
right, there you have it. The playground
plugin is an official anthropic based
plug-in that generates interactive
self-contained HTML tools. Every
playground follows the same pattern
controls, live preview, prompt output in
a single HTML file with zero
dependencies. Playgrounds are just HTML
files, fully portable, sharable, and
modifiable. The real shift here isn't
better prompts. It's a new interaction
loop. Claude builds an interface
tailored to your task. You give feedback
through it. Clicks, sliders, approvals.
The playground translates that back into
instructions that Claude understands.
