So, I used to be quite anti-AII. I used
to think it was bit of a gimmick. It's
not really going to help with much. It's
all hype basically. But in the last few
months, a lot has actually changed. And
I've actually never felt so excited to
use AI. And it's well because of one
tool, and that's Claude. To be fair, the
same can apply to other AI tools, but
Claude is just the one that I happen to
be using. I first gave it a whirl back
in September and used it for some basic
stuff like building a photography
website from a folder of photos. But
over the last few months, things have
gotten out of hand and that's what's
made it so exciting to use for me
personally. By the way, I'll leave a
link to my sort of stack that I'm using
when it comes to building stuff. All the
apps, all the softwares, my workflow and
stuff. I'll leave a link to that if you
guys are interested as well. I do want
to give some background context though.
I am not a developer. I don't aim to be
a developer. I don't like coding really.
I've done some coding here and there,
but I'm no programmer. I feel like no
way would I call myself a programmer. I
see myself as someone who likes to use
graphical user interface. I like visual
stuff. It's why I consider myself a
designer instead. But using Claude, I've
started doing silly things that you
probably shouldn't do, but I just feel
like I don't really care because I'm not
doing it with anything that's too
valuable. One of those things is sshing
into my VPS with Claude, giving it a
prompt, and then just letting it do its
thing, which seems to be quite a common
thing that a lot of developers are doing
because if you don't care too much about
what's on the VPS or you're using a sort
of test VPS or something like that,
yeah, sshing into it and just using
Claude and letting it rip is some of the
most fun. Half a year ago, opening the
terminal would have felt like I'm
hacking into the matrix. It was just so
intimidating. I've been designing web
pages and stuff when people were just
starting in apps like Photoshop. Now
though, the terminal has become one of
my favorite apps of choice for design
bizarrely. The great thing is if you
don't like using the terminal, Claude
actually now have a sort of code tap in
their Mac app which lets you build stuff
without having to use terminal. It just
looks like a normal sort of chat
prompting app. But let's go back a bit
because the first thing I wanted to do
with Claude was to make a sort of Zapia
make alternative. Yeah, I know. What the
hell was I even thinking? Because that
building something like that is just
absurd. Like, it's silly to try.
However, Claude recommended using NA10.
I'd never heard of NA10 before. And boy,
I wish I had because NA10 is essentially
a sort of automation workflow platform
that has superpowers. You can use it to
basically automate anything and
everything. And what drew me to it was
that they have a self-hosted version,
which is even better. I have full
control of it, and I only pay for the
hosting. After a lot of research and
actually asking Claude, "How should I
host this thing?" They recommended
Hostinger, which lines up perfectly
because they're also sponsoring this
video. N810 is so popular that Hostinger
literally have a dedicated workflow for
installing N810. Like, it's by far the
easiest way possible. So, when you go to
the Hostinger website, you go to
services in the top left, you can see
all these different things, but you can
also see self-hosted NA10. When you
click on it, you can see the different
pricing and stuff they have. They have a
bunch of deals here. KVM2 is the one I
personally went for and it's the one
that I'm using it for because my
workflows right now are quite limited.
So, if I do need to upgrade in the
future, I can. But KVM2 is the one that
made sense for me. So, you can choose
the plan. You can go through the whole
registration and payment processing, but
you can also use the code olia 10 and
that will give you 10% off it as well.
So, it brings it down to $150 for a
2-year plan, which is just absolute
bargain. I did a ton of research trying
to find actually one of the cheapest
ways to do it and hosting ended up being
one of the cheapest ways to do And then
once it's installed, you can simply just
open it and then I can just go through
the whole setup process of setting N810
up. It's really that easy, that quick.
Like it literally takes less than five
minutes. It's unbelievable how quick
hosting have made it. And the great
thing is it doesn't have to stop there.
I can install other things on it like
open claw or any other sort of Docker
apps that I like and use claw to manage
them, whatever, login through terminal
and just have it all managed. Like I
don't have to worry about it. It's super
easy. That's the great thing about
having a VPS. You can sort of do
whatever you like with it and self-host
it, self-manage it. I'll leave an
affiliate link below and my coupon code
so you can get 10% off as well. The
great thing about using Claude code with
my VPS as well is that when I'm stuck or
there's something that doesn't work or
I've broken something, I can have Claude
just manage the whole thing for me. I
don't really have to learn server
management when Claude is my server
manager. Once I installed NA10, I
started asking Claude, "Hey, what are
some other things that I could sort of
self-host?" And I was looking for a sort
of Google Analytics uh alternative
because Google Analytics to me is just
so bloated. There's just so much going
on. And I came across Plausible
Analytics and they have a self-hosted
version as well. But I thought, okay,
let's take this a step further. Instead
of even using hosting as sort of um
manager for managing the VPS, could I
just log in with Claude and then have it
install Plausible for me? And yeah, it
just did it. A couple minutes later, I
had an instance of Plausible running and
I could start using it and installing it
on my websites and tracking all the
analytics. It just blew my mind because
I would have never have done anything
like this in the past. I'm a complete
beginner. I'm a complete noob. I don't
really know this stuff. Yet, here I am
with the VPS with both NA10 and
Plausible installed 6 months ago.
Honestly, I would have given up if I
came across any minor issue. What I had
been doing at the beginning when using
Claudet is that I was just winging my
way through all of it. However, I did
come up with the realization that if I
want to build actual websites and apps,
I need to have a system. But doing
things the proper way also just seemed
archaic and slow. I just wanted to
prompt and refine and build something.
So, I came across an app called
Conductor, which I like to see as a sort
of juiced up terminal, a nicer looking
terminal. You can connect your LLM of
choice. So, whether you're using include
or whether you're using Codex, it
doesn't really matter. You can use
whatever you like. And on the left you
have your sort of repost. In the middle
you have your chat interface. And then
on the right you can see the sort of
your files what's been changed. You can
review and also you can see the terminal
as well. All of this in this one app. It
just looks so much cleaner than just
using the terminal. I found for me
personally this has been the most
enjoyable way for me to make stuff and
also make sure that I'm I have some sort
of system in place. Bad habit that I
used to have in the past is that when I
did build stuff I didn't back it up to
GitHub. I didn't have versioning or
anything like that. Now with this, I can
do all of that and just let it automate
it. I can even take it a step further.
So anything I build locally and then
upload it to GitHub, I can then connect
my GitHub to Hostinger and Hostinger can
deploy anything that I build. Like for
me, that was a holy crap moment because
that's when I came to the realization I
can automate this whole workflow and I
don't really have to do anything apart
from prompt. It's just crazy. Now the
hard part is actually just making
something good. At least it's not as
unhinged as before where I was just sort
of putting stuff straight into a VPS.
Now that I have the system in place with
conductor hosting and and GitHub and
everything and all of it sort of working
in harmony, it's great because
everything just works. Once I'd learned
the ropes, I thought, okay, let's try
and build something proper. So I
actually ended up building a website
called Digital Creator Club. And it's
basically a website that has a payw
wall, a login. It can help sort of
connect buyers to their Discord and it
has a sort of nice membership card as
well. I would have never have been able
to build something like this in the past
because it's just a bit too custom. I
would have had to sort of hack things
together, use out of the box solutions,
use other softwares or whatever. But
with clawed code, I was able to build
something the way I want and have it
completely custom and also add things if
I want to. I can add new features. I can
add new functionality, which is what I'm
planning to do over the next however
many months and years. What's crazy is
that in the first week of launching
Digital Creator Club, it made nearly
$20,000,
which just blows my mind. I can't
believe that many people bought the the
sort of membership, the club. I'm going
to be adding a bunch of stuff for it.
You guys can check it out or not check
it out. Doesn't really matter. But yeah,
I think it's a good example of something
that I built with Claude. It honestly
blows my mind that a year ago, I was
barely using AI. mainly because most of
the people that were sort of using AI
and the sort of stuff that I'd hear
about it, people were doing things like
rewriting things like emails and essays
and so on. That functionality just
didn't really interest me. But now that
I can use it to sort of build actual
software and apps and websites and
automate things, I've realized my
capabilities to make money with Claw
Code has just absolutely exploded. And
that's what I'm focusing on now. I want
to build stuff. I want to make stuff. I
want to do stuff where it can help me
make money. That's the whole point of
this channel, why I make videos on this
channel, because I'm trying to figure
out different ways to make money,
different solutions, and just sort of
share my process and story along the
way. Check out this other video I did on
high income skills for 2026, what I
think is worth learning, and also how I
made $50,000 from selling iPhone
wallpapers, which just still blows my
mind. I can't believe I made that much
money.
