I'm going to give you along with
hundreds of other designers a really
cool experiment. I want to see how far
we can take AI design and this time is
specific to Claude code to produce a
hero section all on the same fictional
business idea. So, currently there's an
ongoing 30-day UI design challenge at
designcourse.com. It's 100% free. We've
already had one challenge and we've had
over 200 submissions. And this is the
second challenge. I'm going to show you
how to use Claude Code and equip it with
a special design skill in order to
produce some really good designs. And
the goal with this challenge is I'm
going to give you all the same fictional
business idea, but we're going to see
how good your prompting skills are to
create the best UI possible for this
task. So, in a little bit, I'll show you
exactly how you partake in this
challenge today, no matter what time
you're watching this. Could be months
after this. You can always participate
in this challenge to see what people are
doing. But first, I'm going to show you
how to set up everything you need. So,
first, you're obviously going to need
Claude Code. All right, so this is the
page for setting it up. There's
different environments. I'm not going to
go through all of it. So, I'm just going
to link the setup page. You can figure
out how to install it if you haven't
yet. And once it's ready, all you have
to do is type in Claude and it should
load up right here. Okay. Now, the next
step is to make sure you equip it with a
special skill. Now, a skill is just a
set of instructions really that's fed
into the context of the AI. And there's
a bunch of different skills. So, before
I show you the skill, this is how you
install skills on your system. You have
to find where your cloud code folder is
based on the OS you're using and the
environment that you're using. And then
you're going to simply take this
markdown file which is a skill and then
place it into that folder. Now the
particular skill I'm talking about is
called front-end design right here. I
will link it here in the description so
that you can access it. Now what you
want to do is click on skills frontend
skills skill.md and then right here
download raw file. All right. So once
you have that skill file, you take it
and you find your claude code folder in
that URL that I just showed you. Now my
folder here on Windows 11 happens to be
crmpt users Gary andclude.
Now inside of here, you may not have a
skills folder. If not, create it. I
already do. Double click it and then
just create a folder called designer.
And then inside of it, that's where you
paste that skill file. Skill.md. Now, if
you already have Claude running, make
sure you close it first by hitting
control C a few times. Type Claude again
and then just type forward slashskills
list all available skills. Right now, I
just have three. We see right here
front-end design. And the way you access
this one is going to be slashfrontend
design. Then you paste in your prompt.
Now, let me show you this in action. So
if I put forward/frontend designer
designer hero section of a landing page
for an AI identity verification service,
it should have a light beige background
with two columns, a strong headline and
a copy on the left with a call to
action. And on the right should be a
fictional but simplistic UI animation
that demonstrates the idea of identity
identity verification. Sorry. Place this
in an HTML file with CSS and include
variables. That's all my prompt is. And
this is what it ended up producing. So,
I don't know about you, but this is
actually really solid and it oneshotted
this. And you saw the prompt. It's very
small. So, I'm going to show you the
challenge and the business idea of the
prompt that I want you to use for the
fictional business, and I want to see
what you can produce. The idea is to
augment it with your own design
preferences. So, you can create
something that's unique and even
animated if you want. So the first step
is to go to the designcourse.com
foundations challenge. The link is below
somewhere. And when you come here,
you'll see this page right here. 613
students already in 197 submissions for
the first challenge that we already had.
This is for the second challenge. All
you have to do is click here and you'll
see get the 2026 UIUX Figma template.
And in there is challenge number two.
And that's what I want you to use. So,
what that looks like is right here. This
is challenge number two. And here are
the instructions. This is part of the
prompt that I want you to include. This
is the fictional business idea. I don't
want you using any other idea. I want us
all to use the same idea. And that is an
AI home inspection business. It uses
computer vision to analyze crawl space,
roof, foundation images for common
defects and autogenerate standardized
inspection reports. Our goal is to
instruct the AI with this right here,
this initial prompt in order to create a
hero section that is next level with our
Claude code designer skill. And over
here are the instructions. All right, so
use Claude code to generate a hero
section for the fictional business idea
featured to the right of this frame over
here. So make sure you paste that in as
a part of your prompt and then include
the business idea, but also include your
own design and styling preferences. So,
that's kind of how I directed it to kind
of create that little animated card that
we just saw. You can use as many prompts
as you want to refine the end result.
You can integrate animation if you wish.
And when you submit, first include the
number of prompts that it took to get to
the end result because I want you to
refine the result if you want to. And
also include the prompt itself in the
comment where you can leave a comment.
Now, you can also use CL the cloud code
to Figma plugin to share a Figma
prototype of the design in your
submission, but you don't have to. Uh, a
screenshot will work just fine. So, the
cloud code to Figma plugin allows you to
take your end result of your UI and then
send it over to Figma. I'm not going to
show you how to do it here because I
literally just uploaded a video
yesterday that shows you how to do that.
Again, you don't have to do that. A
screenshot would work just fine for your
submission. Then when it comes to
submitting your entry right here, it
shows you how to do that. Let's say, for
instance, if you you do decide to share
a Figma document of what you're doing,
which will allow me to make revisions if
I do end up reviewing yours, then you
just hit share over here, click copy
prototype link, make sure anyone can
view it, and then you submit that along
with your submission. So, this is going
to be a really cool challenge because
we're going to see are the results going
to be very similar? Well, they are. if
you don't provide a lot of direction,
your own creative interest in your
stylings and how you infuse your
creative ideas. And so if you do do
that, I think we can see a lot of
interesting variations and concepts that
are produced. So again, specify the
color scheme that you want. Specify any
type of interesting illustrations or
animations that you want. The goal is to
try to maximize what AI can produce. All
right, I hope to see everybody enter
this one. This is a very cool challenge.
