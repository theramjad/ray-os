Hello. Hello there. How's it going
everybody? Today we're going to go over
my 50 cloud code tips. I've been working
with cloud code basically every day for
about 6 months now. And I feel like I've
learned a ton of things. And yes, I am
one of those engineers that are
basically not writing code anymore. I'm
still in cloud code like 12 hours a day
actively pair programming with cloud
code basically and reviewing a ton of
code. I still read every single line of
code. That's actually my biggest
bottleneck right now, the reviewing of
the code. But I thought it would be
great to show you kind of the best tips
that I've learned along the way. And
these are kind of tips that I wish I
knew when I was first getting started.
We're going to start off with some
foundation stuff like setting up very
quick setup stuff, a little bit about
like cloud.md rules, like what you
should put in, what you should think
about, and kind of some of the advanced
stuff for later. But without further
ado, let's dive into 50 cloud code tips.
So, I got my terminal here and I just
have some slides behind to uh tell you
guys what I'm doing. So, here is the
foundations that I mentioned. We're
going to cover getting started, keyboard
shortcuts, some essential like slash
commands, and a little bit of a deep
dive into the claw.md. So, let's get
started. All right. So, for tip number
one, you want to run cloud code in your
root directory of whatever project
you're working on. So, for example, I
have this Pomodoro app that I'm like
kind of been working on. So, I'll type
in like claude here. And that's
essentially how you get started. And you
really want to do this because uh later
we'll talk about this, but if you have
rule files or any kind of setup, the
initial root directory is where Claude
is going to zip up the context into that
first token. So, if you ever wonder why
you had a bunch of tokens used even
though you just opened up Cloud, this is
probably the reason why. is because
Claude's getting your project ready. All
right. So, one of the first things that
you want to do is run slashinit
like that. And what this does is claude
will go and look at your codebase and do
an analysis of your codebase and then
create that initial claw.md file in the
cloud directory of your codebase. Now,
there is like different directories that
you could source from like you could
have a global one or like this one. But
yeah, at a high level, what this is
doing right now is just it's just
looking at the codebase, looking for the
architecture and then basically it's
creating that claw.md. All right, so it
just finished. It does take some time
and as you can see, it's kind of going
and saying, oh, this is this is like a
nextjs 15 app. It's like a portfolio
site. Yeah, it's just going over
highlevel things about this particular
project. uh and then you could just
essentially hit yes to commit that to
your doclaw. So this is like really
important for new projects. So I highly
recommend you to run it. All right. So
the tip number two is that claw.md file
that we just created. It kind of runs on
a hierarchy. So if you go to
memory/memory,
you could kind of see right here that
there is a checked in memory which is
the current root directory and then
there's a user memory. This is like your
global one. So that's like in your
tilda.claw. claude/cloud.
So you could kind of choose between it,
but it's it's really there so you can
know what the core rule that the cloud
code is operating on right now. Looking
at the cloud.md that claw just created
like this is a pretty good one to get
started, right? It it just has like you
you don't want it to be too large. It's
like very small, right? I I think around
300 lines is about a decent place that
you want to aim for. And to be honest,
going larger is fine, but just remember
that every time you increase that
initial context window, you're going to
use more tokens first of all, but also
the more bloat you have in your context,
the less likely the AI will do exactly
what you're trying to do. All right, so
for structure and what you should be
thinking about putting into your cloud.
MD, I just opened another project. This
one is my anime Pomodoro. This is an iOS
app. So I wanted to show you a little
bit more examples but basically the
things I like to put is like highle
technical architecture and the
requirements you know like what is the
project like that's kind of important
and then you want to give it like some
domain context right like oh it's using
swift UI and I probably would add highle
architecture and like kind of the file
path and things like that and just some
of the highle design patterns like
you'll see like all of that should go in
here and And then one of the important
thing is kind of having your build flow
like your validation flow. And this is
like kind of where my build and
validation is. So you can see that I'll
like build the Xcode and then build the
project, make sure things compile. Just
having this loop of validation is so
amazing because the AI will just be able
to self-improve and keep going until it
fixes itself. So like if you were ever
in a situation where you just like ask
cursor to do something or ask some AI
code agent to do something and it just
doesn't work a lot of that gets resolved
when you fix the validation. And
validation, I think as a side tip, is
probably one of the most important
topics that you should really think
about when you're thinking about trying
to build good AI agentic like coding
systems or any workflows is really what
is the validation loop because that will
dramatically improve how good your AI
will be. All right, so let's go to some
keyboard shortcuts. And the reason why I
even have this entire section for this
is because if you're going to be in
cloud code all day every day, like if
you're an engineer, you're just going to
be on this workhorse for quite a while.
So you should learn how to actually use
most useful hotkeys. And there's
essentially shift tab toggle modes is
pretty useful. And that's just like
hitting shift and tab. And then you can
see right here that we're switching from
accept edits to plan mode. I actually
use plan mode quite heavily. I I think I
use plan mode almost exclusively
whenever I start a new feature. It's
rare that I start in edit mode. I always
just want to verify and double check
that my assumptions about the codebase
that I'm working on and the the
direction that I'm trying to go with is
the best option. So, I usually start in
plan mode and I spend a decent amount of
time before I go to accept and just like
start execution. All right, escape
interrupts. Let me just get something
started here. Tell me a good way to plan
a live activity for when I background
the app. Okay, so I'm going to let this
go to show you guys what escaping the
interrupts is. But you can see that
Claude is like thinking here and it's
like going through and doing things.
Sometimes if especially during plan
mode, you want to kind of like look at
this and look at the thinking and see if
it's going off track. If it is, you just
hit escape and then it interrupts. Now,
a lot of people might be like kind of
like scared to interrupt it, but you can
just like hit up and then go right back
to where you're doing or you could just
interrupt it and tell it something else.
The whole point is Claude Code has a
really good way of like dduping and
entering prompts in a nice queue. it
like it logically knows what to do. So
you don't have to be so scared to like
enter more than one prompt and also like
escaping early and interrupting and
changing course like it's actually
recommended to do that. Tip number eight
is if you ever had something like really
big or you copy pasted something and
you're like oh I don't want to delete
everything. A handy shortcut here is
just double tap escape and it'll clear
the input. There's also a vim mode if
you're into that, but I use this all the
time. Another thing is when you're on a
empty input, if you double tap escape,
you'll see that you can rewind to like a
previous point uh and then restore that
context point. This is kind of common
with clock code, but a lot of the tools
I feel like is really built to manage
your context and context engineering.
And then there's just like an agent that
is wrapped around the orchestration. But
a lot of the like slash commands and
stuff that we'll be going over, I feel
like it's it's really to manage that
context window. All right, screenshots
is obviously a pretty common thing to
do. There's a lot of ways to do it, but
you can essentially take a screenshot
and then drag it over and just drop it
in. And then obviously another good tip
is to add context. This is a cool
picture of the Clock mascot. Do
something with it. I don't know. But
yeah, so that's a really good example of
like taking a screenshot and bringing it
over. If you are doing any kind of UI
work, you'll definitely use this
workflow. I also highly recommend
finding like a Figma MCP or some form of
MCP that works really good with the
specific validation that you're trying
to do. All right, moving on to essential
commands and this is slash commands.
Before I end on the keyboard shortcuts,
there's a lot more keyboard shortcuts,
things that I don't use all the time.
And if you just go to like /help, you'll
be able to see a bunch of them. But the
ones that I covered, I use all the time
every day. So definitely just memorize
it. I think it'll be really useful. Now,
essential commands is like the slash
commands that I think you should know
about. There's way more slash commands
and you could like make your own slash
commands, but these are the ones that I
think is useful. All right, so slashcle
is basically a way to clear the context.
Now, you could actually do this by just
creating another instance of Claude,
right? That's basically the same thing.
But if you don't want to like do that,
you could just clear the context. And
this is really good if you want to start
a new feature and you're completely done
with the old task and you don't want the
old context to blow up the new context
and influence the new project that
you're doing. All right, so I just
loaded some stuff. Let's uh go into
slashcontext.
What this does is it will give you like
a visual representation of the current
context that cloud code is operating in.
Now why is this useful? So the main
reason why this is useful is because it
gives you an opportunity to reason about
the context that cloud code is making
assumptions on on your codebase. Now, I
always say context is best served fresh
and condensed. And you really want to
take a look at this from time to time.
If you ever felt like cloud code has
regressed and like things are not
working the way it is or your like cost
and usage like bill is going up, you
really want to look at this and then see
which are like the most biggest
offenders, right? You just want to like
audit it. Like MCPs are one of those
very common things that blows up your
tokens. I mean like look at all of this
Xcode related MCPS and every time it
runs it like I mean these are not a lot
because I haven't been doing that much
in this particular workflow but you
could just imagine that once I start
doing those iteration cycles this like
usage will like blow up but yeah so if
you look at this and you're like oh this
MCP is using so much then you could
remove it or just disable it for this
directory. So slash context is something
that you probably should not ignore.
Again, I think cloud code, all of the
tools is really there to manage a lot of
the context and doing really good
context engineering. So, this is a good
uh slash command. All right. So, in
terms of compaction, like if you use
cloud code at all, if you had a long
session, it will start autoco compacting
at some point. All auto compaction does
is just takes your current context
window like context that you created and
then it will just summarize it and then
it does a pretty good job. For my
projects, I usually just let the autoco
compaction work. But if you really want
to compact what you have right now, you
could just compact. But I I rarely use
this. The only time I use this is if I
want to save some version of my context
into like my local like second brain. If
you haven't seen that video, go and
check it out. But I have this second
brain concept when I work on projects
and that's where that goes. So for
slashmodels, this is like very useful. I
think if you have unlimited tokens, like
if you're doing this at work, for me, I
usually just uh default it to Opus 4.5,
but if you're very like cost sensitive
and you know certain workflows work well
in Sonnet or like I coup, then you could
just go and change that. Um, keeping at
default is fine too, but I would try to
use Opus as much as possible. All right,
so slashresentally
like lost your instance. Let's say you
created another one and then you
accidentally killed it or something like
that, right? Oh, you killed the wrong
one or something. Then when you go back
into claw code, you could do slash
resume
like so. And then it'll give you kind of
the old context and then you could like
recover your context so that you don't
lose the all the work that you did in
building up that context window. All
right. slashmcp is really about um
showing the MCPS that you have
installed. If I have to be honest, I try
very very hard to not use MCPS because I
think they blow up your context window.
So I only install ones that are needed
for that very specific project and I try
to just leverage cloud code and write
scripts and like these kind of things
manually like myself to do the
validations and things like that. But
some projects you just do need MCPs like
this Xcode one, you kind of need it. And
for other projects like my Nex.js apps,
I have like a whole set of MCPS for
that. But just be careful with MCPS. But
it's a really fantastic way to teach
Claude how to do certain things,
especially with like third-party
software and things like that. You know,
it's a protocol, right? Model context
protocol. So, it's basically used
everywhere, but again, it's known to
blow up your token usage and your
context window. So just be careful. All
right. So slashhelp is the last thing
I'm going to teach you. You know, teach
a man how to fish. So this like little
wizard here will just teach you what
they are and give you like descriptions
of everything. So just go ahead and like
try these out and just take a look and
you know explore. All right. So the next
thing is around git. So you could ask
cloud code to manage your git. I think
there's a bunch of like skills you could
download to cloud code to manage all
your git. And I think that's something
that you should do. Like I write a lot
of my summaries and test plans all using
like cloud code. Now obviously I have my
own templates that I wrote. So claude
kind of sounds more like me and is not
too verbose and things like that. So I
highly recommend you to use git as a
safety net. There is actually a rewind
feature like I think I told you where
you could restore the code and the
conversation but this is a little
confusing to me like git is just better.
I use this as like a last resort if I
didn't have git for a certain
checkpoint. So now that you know how to
just navigate around cloud code and
things like that and just kind of
highlevel important like commands and
things like that, I think it's a good
time to deep dive into the claw.md file.
I think for most people, most users,
like 80% of users, if you just have a
really good claw.md file for your
project, you could get really, really
far without learning like all the
advanced stuff. Just having a really
good rules file will save you a lot of
headaches. Let's kind of dive a little
bit deep into this. Okay. So, one of the
most important things in the claw.md
files is first of all, it's like it
actually reads top to bottom and it
keeps the priority from top to bottom. I
think that's like a very small nuance.
I'm pretty sure that's true. I think I
read that somewhere, but it Yeah. So,
you want to go top to bottom as like
important to least important. And you
want to add things that are like never
do something, but always do this. and
then have like clear snippets of
examples I think is really good and I
don't have that many on this particular
project because it's stock swift UI but
the context here is that you should
really think about how unique is your
project how many things about your
project is like homegrown and
essentially like the AI may have never
seen like remember a lot of this code is
like basically a lot of the AI like
coding is basically just an accumulation
of like the s code that the AI is
trained on. So, it might not know your
like super special DSL language that you
created or like some random archaic
patterns that your company has. And
that's where you'll be like, "Oh, why is
the AI never doing this?" So, whenever
you run into something like that, you
want to fix it manually and then you
just update your claw.md rules so that
it never does that mistake again. Think
of it as like lint files kind of. And
then when you ask claw to update the
rules, you shouldn't ever do it
manually. You should just go here into
claw and and say, "Hey, can you update
that rule for me so we never do it
again?" Something like that. Like as
simple as that will go and update your
claw.md files. You see how it's trying
to do it? Obviously, there's nothing
that I just did. So, this has nothing to
add, but yeah. Okay. it it added
something that I thought but you get the
point. All right, so this next one is
really around using like keywords to
trigger your skills. So basically I have
these like build commands inside of my
rules. So when I say hey use my Xcode
MCP to build it will try to build the
app for example. Use my Xcode MCP to
build the app.
Okay, my whisper stuff is like failing a
little bit, but maybe it'll get the gist
of it from build the app. And as you can
see, it's it's asking if I can use the
XCO build MCP. So that's kind of the
high level of like using skills and like
trigger words to be able to trigger
certain behavior. This next one is
something called like compound
engineering. That's like kind of a new
term that is being discussed, but it's
essentially to take your claw.md and
start like committing it into the
codebase. Now, obviously, you need to
get rid of anything that's like generic
for your code like file path and things
like that. And you also want to be
mindful of how large this file becomes,
right? Because like I said, every time
someone hits claude in that directory or
claude is trying to read that directory,
it will load that claw.md file. So you
don't want to blow up other people's
context windows. So you really want to
be have this be like a high bar when
you're committing it. But the nice thing
is once that's in, you essentially make
that AI coding experience better for
your teammates. But you just need to
make sure that whatever you're landing
is actually helping. There's a lot of
school of thoughts around this right
now. I don't think it's like completely
solved, but there's got to be some form
of evaluations here. And a lot of people
are just using like vibes. So, you just
like test it for like a few weeks and
then you just try to land it and then
ask for feedback essentially. So,
dangerously skip is essentially like
claw code in yolo mode. Um, you know,
like just basically if you use claw
code, it will ask you to accept a bunch
of stuff. It could get really annoying.
So a lot of people they use you know
claude and then dash dangerously skip.
Okay. So it's dash dangerously skip
permissions. And when you run this cloud
code will no longer ask you essentially
to accept that. I think it will
completely just ignore it except for
like anything you put into your slash
permissions which we'll talk about. But
you only really want to do this in in
environments that you can kind of throw
away and you're doing specific work that
is not like super dangerous. Like if
you're going to start touching the OS
and stuff like that, you could really
mess it up. I've messed up some of my
Linux machines because I was just going
too aggressive and I was just testing it
out and I was trying to set up some of
my Linux stuff using claw code and then
like I had to reflash the entire thing.
Like I said, you can use
slashpermissions here to kind of like uh
tell which ones are like you still want
to accept. So it does, you know, like
rm-rf or something like don't do that or
Yeah, just like mutations like just be
careful with mutations like deletion
mutations, right? Um, all right. The
next big one I think now that we talked
a little bit about the cloudmd rule
files, I think we should talk about
workflows because I have a very specific
way I like to work and I've actually
refactored my entire work so that it's
works with cloud code. You know, I used
to use cursor or like Android Studios
mostly and VS Code to do a lot of coding
and stuff like that. But I dropped
basically all of that and I use just
iTerms. Now, um, some people use
obviously Vim, but I think iTerms is
fine. So, I'm going to show you guys a
few things. So,
like I said, I always start with plan
mode. Let's go and like plan like a
little feature for this Pomodoro app
that I've been like kind of working on.
I don't know. I actually need to remove
a bunch of audio stuff. So, let's just
say audit my codebase and make sure that
we're removing all of the audio playback
and references to the audio of part of
the Pomodoro app. I'll always start with
plan mode and I'm like iterating with
Claude code. I'm arguing with it. I'm
having a conversation with it. You know,
Cloud Code, you're so beautiful. You're
so amazing. [laughter] No, but like I'm
really treating it as like another like
just good engineer that I'm like working
with and I never just like purely accept
the first answers that it gives to me. I
always kind of challenging it and I
spend a lot of time and put a lot of
effort at this stage of the development
because I feel like once cloud code
builds up that context and have good
execution specs, the generation of the
code is actually the easy part. And I I
do want to take a moment and talk about
like kind of the news cycle about people
saying, "Oh, like people are no longer
writing code." I think like the creator
of NO.js said like the era of like
people writing code by hand is
essentially over. And I actually truly
believe that. And the thing is I love
like being in the zone and writing code.
At least I used to. The thing is it's
really hard to get back into that mode.
It's like very different levels of
abstractions of the way you're working.
And right now I'm just doing one
instance of it. But you could imagine um
just having like multiple clawed
instances like this and and and then
you're just actively working on a bunch
of different things at the same time
because you have this like new
superpower. The new next level of
engineering is really like jumping
between clawed instances and and really
context engineering that instance and
then getting it good enough to start
executing. And I keep talking about this
like context, right? And this tip is
really around like fresh context beats
like bloated context. I think I kind of
cover this throughout this, but that's
why you want to start with plan mode.
make sure it's good and then just go and
execute instead of like having a bunch
of like try this and then try that and
then try this and then try that. Like
that will just bloat that context and
then the AI will get really confused at
some point because it it can't remember
what what part of what was good and not
good. So that's why you want to spend
the time in the beginning building up
the good context. have a good plan dog.
So, it always has something that
initially was good to reference and then
it builds little by little. All right.
So, this next one is really around um
persisting that context. Uh I have a
full video on this about like the second
brain concept. So, I'll link it here.
But the idea here is that let's say you
finished something, you could just say
save this to my local claw.md in my
projects directory. Save the work that
we just did. So you you could say
something like that and then um I I
essentially have a full workflow for
this to manage this. But yeah, you could
do that load my context from my local
projects. So once you have that second
brain concept, you could say a command
like this and it will pull that context
and then load it for your new session.
So here's a good example. I like to do a
lot of my todos inside of cloud code
itself. These are kind of the highle
things that I still need to do for this
next feature that I'm working on. So I'm
like working on a widget for this
Pomodoro app and I have like a live
activity for example and I'm also like
deleting all the music stuff because I
don't think it adds value. So I have a
bunch of stuff that I'm tracking but
because I keep all the to-dos in my
local index like that I'm lazy loading.
I don't always load it. I only lazy load
it when I ask for it. It allows me to
like context switch from project to
project without like carrying around
like complex I don't know a sauna boards
or whatever. I just keep it all in here
and it's this is this works because it's
my own project. But you can technically
do this with like an MCP with a sauna or
I don't know Jira or whatever as long as
you can whatever project management that
you can think of. All right. So, I think
we covered this a little bit, but really
think about the build cycle. Like,
obviously, if you're mobile, think about
Xcode, building the Xcode, but there's a
lot of other workflows that you could
think of. Like, for example, you could
ask Cloud Code to like let's say you're
debugging something that's like kind of
tricky, has like race conditions or
things like that. You could ask Cloud
Code to like add debug logs for example,
and then run the app and then have Cloud
Code control the emulator. You could
just ask it to do that and then like do
the actions that you're trying to do and
then read the logs through a tail log or
something and then debug that way. Or
you could use like peretto or something
like that. So for kind of performance
things you could hook into peretto mcps
do a run and then have it read the
traces and then see if it can find jenk
just from like the timings, right?
There's just so many validation loops
that you could think of. Like for web,
you could do like puppeteer and have
claude navigate it using a /chrome
command and then just actually do the
navigation or have it write just test or
have like integration end to end
integration test. You know, there's
there's a lot of things that clock could
do and it really is up to your
imagination, but it's the single most
important thing in my opinion if you
want to have a more automated loop that
like generates good code on like the
first try. So going back to the
slashmodels really just consider using
Opus if you can afford it. It's just the
best way. All of these are a little bit
slower but because the way I work is I
have multiple cloud instances. Obviously
it's like very small right in here but I
have multiple cloud instances running at
all times and then the way I work is
basically just juggling these cloud
instances. So even if one of them takes
a long time, it doesn't matter because
I'm like I gave the command and I go to
the next one. I'm building the context.
I give a command and I go to the other
one and then I give a command. So So
like you end up like still can get into
the zone, but it's like a different
style. So, I talked a little bit about
interrupting earlier, but you really
want to like look out for like
assumptions or the key words are like,
"Oh, I'm not really sure." Or you'll see
like errors happening. I'm having a hard
time like getting it to do this in this
example, but um just just know that like
when you go and look for the best ways
to delete an app. I don't know.
[laughter]
I I'm just giving it a random prompt to
try to make it go off course. But if you
see it going and making assumptions
about certain things, okay, this time it
didn't even really because it's just
new. But you should just interrupt it
like that, you know, and then and then
just course correct it. So don't worry
about course correcting. Okay, so the
next section is around power users. I I
don't really like to say power users,
but most people that I've talked to
don't really know like the differences
between a slash command or a skill.
They're they're kind of interchangeable
now. And MCPs, sub aents, you know, post
hooks, pre- hooks, like these kind of
primitives that cloud code is like known
for and kind of like invented. And we're
going to cover some of that and and how
this these are all like composable in
nature. Okay, so I call it the
composability framework, but it's I just
really wanted to highlight that these
are composable more than anything. But
there's four primitive like composable
things. All the slash commands are
technically composable with each other,
not directly each other, but anyways, so
we're going to just go over the fact
that like how these are composable.
Okay, so let's first talk about skills.
All a skill is is like you do a
workflow. So let's say that um I tell
claude go and fetch hacker news for
latest iOS news.
So let's say I tell it to go and fetch
hacker news for the latest iOS news and
then and then I tell it to save that.
Okay. and then save um a summary to my
local
uh claude.md
claw directory.
Okay, I misspelled that. But basically,
let's say that it went and found some
and then it's save it into my local
directory. Let's say I wanted to build a
skill around that. So, you just saw me
do two things. One is fetch something
from a source like hackernews and then
save that thing to my local directory.
That's technically a workflow. So all
you have to say do is save what we just
did into a new skill called fetch
hackernews. And that's basically it to
create a skill. It's basically a
recurring workflow that you can just
tell Claude to remember. And behind the
scenes, it's actually just an MD file as
you can see right here. Oops. And as you
can see here, it's literally just a
system prompt. It's an MD file, but
Claude has specific directories that is
looking for skills and will be able to
infer this next time I say go fetch
something from hackernews or use my
hackernew skill to fetch articles. Yeah.
And then commands is basically now
interchangeable. It's it's a pretty
recent change, but you can see that um
skills is written into the skills
documentary and it there's also now a
slash command called slashfetch
hackernews. This is a very recent change
from anthropic where they kind of like
combined uh commands and skills. But
yeah, so now you can just do slhacker
news and then now it'll rerun that
system prompt. For example, it added
like an additional like assumption
thing. That's pretty cool. It's not
exactly what I did, but it kind of
inferred that I would probably want
that. So, those are the little cool
things. And the thing is you could
update these anytime you want. You know,
you could just ask clot to do do
something else.
All right. So, like I said, you never
want to manually create these kind of
stuff. You want to get in the habit of
asking Claude to update and manage these
skills. So we could say why don't you
extend this fetch hacker news to fetch
Twitter or Apple news for example. Now
sometimes it won't work 100% exactly
right. Okay. So you see this it doesn't
have Twitter authentication access. So
it's trying to just do some other ways.
Yeah. Multiple sources. So you can see
how it's all updating that system
problem that we wrote, right? and then
fetch hacker news and so forth. You you
get the idea. All right. So, MCPs, I
think we covered it a little bit during
the the rules, but basically MCPs, you
just want to find MCPS like this, right?
Like they're just model contextes. But
kind of a hack is like you don't
actually need to search the web for an
MCP. You could just be like, "Find me a
good Figma MCP." you could just ask
Claude to find it for you and then most
of the time it does a good job. The only
thing is like uh sometimes it's outdated
so it'll it'll like know of one that's
like was popular a little while ago
rather than doing a web search. So you
just have to be mindful and that's why
I'm saying like for certain actions you
want to read how what it's doing and
look at the thinking and then cancel it
if you want to. And you could have
Claude also install the MCP. So you
don't have to like manage like the
configs and stuff yourself like you had
to with cursor. Yeah. So you could ask
Claude to install the MCPS. So like
right here it says go and do this,
right? But instead I could just be like
why don't you just install this for me
for example? And then it will just go
and install it for you. All right. So in
terms of sub agents, I don't know if I
have one for this. I might have like
an iOS I might have one like an iOS like
context scattering or like architecture
agent. Let me try it. So spawn a iOS
architecture
agent sub agent and do some
investigation on and on my codebase and
see if it's actually good or not.
Um, so you can build sub agents just
like you can with uh slash commands and
skills. All you do is just ask it to
make a sub agent after you do the work
once. The main reason why you want to
create a sub agent is really to do
parallel work, but also it's to protect
your context window. So like I said, one
of the key features of cloud code is to
manage your context and do context
engineering. And sub agent is a huge
way. And I think a lot of people are
using sub aents incorrectly because they
do things like this where you have like
an iOS sub agent, right? By the way,
it's not triggering the sub agent. I'll
just make one after it creates it and
show you guys what it looks like. It
like highlights it in like a different
color. But a lot of them have this like
workflow where they'll tell it to go do
something that does the context
gathering and then they ask to like
bring it back but that part that portion
of the context that's bring brings back
from the sub agent it's only like the
output it's not like how it got there so
it doesn't have the full context. So for
those kind of works I usually just keep
it within the context window because
those are the things that are really
good. use what we just did to create a
iOS architecture sub agent. But yeah, so
so often times people mistake that you
want to like have a validator agent, you
want to have like a testing agent and
all these kind of things. But I try to
keep the all the things that need that
context to do its work within the same
cloud code session because like a good
testing agent needs to know about the
code that it wrote most of the time. in
my opinion. Of course, sometimes things
could live in isolation. So, what are
really good things for sub agents is
really just like things that are atomic
in nature that you want to just have it
run as side effects and just go and do.
But yeah, so that's what I use sub
agents for. I don't use sub agents that
often. I know some people like love
using them, but one of the most common
like clowny kind of use cases that I've
seen is like CEO agent, product agent,
design agent, and stuff like that. And I
don't really believe in that particular
workflow. Like you really want to have
this concept of bringing the work to the
context rather than trying to spread out
the context that's gets created. All
right. So, and this kind of ties into it
like you want to avoid like having a lot
of instructions and overloading the
context all the time. You want to keep
your context condensed and fresh. So
that watch my video on the second brain
and you like that's it'll teach you a
lot about like lazy loading and then
having this like ongoing project domain
thing that builds over time and you want
to essentially use that as your rag
system to build like a good context and
then be able to just have fresh and good
context all the time for your AI to
execute on. All right. So, here is some
interesting like advanced workflows. And
I really think that the big game changer
in my opinion for cloud code and why I
think cloud code is just so amazing is
that you can do a lot of parallel
development. This is why I had to like
fully change how I work using like
terminal and stuff because you could run
multiple instances. And I already kind
of showed you guys this, but you could
just swap between these and just have
like multiple things running at the same
time. So I could say start working on my
live activities feature. So I could just
have that. Obviously I would do it in
plan mode, but I'm just showing you
guys. And then over here I could just
say all right let's test out this iOS
architecture and and then just spawn a
sub agent. So as you can see I'm doing
some investigation on one side and then
I'm doing live code editing. But the
thing is I could always just create
another one go to like a different
project like this and then now I could
be saying hey I want to work on a new
newsletter
for example. So I could be doing a bunch
of stuff all at the same time. So that's
like a really so understanding how to
juggle this and doing it effectively I
think is like the next step function
change and I just want to kind of shout
out it terms I think it's like really
good um because you know you could do
command D to create new instances like
this right and then you could juggle
between uh the terminals using command
um uh the left bracket and right bracket
like ignore this like slash it's like
I'm just saying, oh, it's left bracket
or right bracket like slash, right? But
yeah, so and you could do that. You
could also, if you have multiple tabs
like this, you can actually swap between
it. And at work, what I do is I rename
like what I'm doing in here. Like I'll
say local and maybe here I'll say like
remote SSH or something like that. And
then from the remote SSH, I could have
claude like running like this. And I
could spawn a more, you know, and then
and then I could just be going back and
forth here. So, it really feels like I'm
playing Starcraft to some degree, right?
And all of these I'm just doing with uh
my keyboard. And when I'm home, I'll
just like be in Whisper using Whisper,
which is like this voice little thing
that you see right here. And it just
translates speech to text really
quickly. Sometimes it's not that
accurate, but so I'm just like switching
switching and I'm just basically talking
to it, you know, just literally working
as in multiple projects all at the same
time. I think my bottleneck right now is
really how much context switching I can
do in my head. So yeah, another thing is
enabling notifications. You could tell
clock code to change the notifications,
right? Uh you could just say change the
notification to ring a little sound when
you finish execution, for example. And
then when is now it will basically ring
like a little notification and you could
do a lot of things. At one point I had
like um text to speech where it like
reads a summary of uh one of wherever it
finish it will read a summary. So I
could be like okay I got to go back to
tab two and then go do something. Um but
that was too much so I disabled it. Gig
work trees is another way to do multiple
code execution. So, one of the
bottlenecks that you'll see is if you
have these kind of like bunch of
multiple instances, you'll soon realize
if you're doing local development, you
won't be able to make code edits the
same project unless you use git work
trees. And I'll add some descriptions on
how to use git work trees. But
basically, it's it's a way to like clone
multiple instances of your codebase and
have like different forking branches.
So, you could have like you could work
on like code like executions in the same
project. Uh, slashchrome is actually a
really cool tool in my opinion. So, the
way you get to it is by just doing
slashchrome like this and then it'll go
to like /chrome and then it'll open this
thing. You can't see it here, but
there's like a little button and it just
opens it and you could actually navigate
the browser. So, go to tip number 46.
So what it does is it will look at the
website and and you could approve the
plan. You could allow the action. So
basically it will create the plan and
then it will like do it. Okay. It
doesn't it doesn't really know how to do
it. So um I'll say
hit let's just try YouTube. I think
YouTube might be easier.
Okay. So we'll we'll open YouTube and
it'll say find a video on
cooking
for example.
Yep.
So you can see that it like takes a
screenshot. It will like click it'll
type cooking and then it will like find
cooking videos for example. And then so
I use this whenever I don't have API
access to certain things but I can get
there via my web and and because you
could control it via slashchrome you can
have it as part like I mentioned that
all of these are composable so you could
have a command that goes to Chrome
scrapes a bunch of stuff and comes back
to you with the data. Okay, so moving
on. Like I mentioned, it's really good
for powerful like debugging, right? You
can navigate the web with it. Uh that's
also part of the validation thing that I
was talking about. You can fill out
forms and stuff. All right, hooks and
automation is really just like kind of
the cherry on top. And this is very
similar to like GitHub's pre hooks and
GitHubs like post like commit stuff like
recommit stuff. So basically these are
hooks and as you can tell it's just like
something to do before you start
executing or after executing and after
executing fails. Like there's all these
things that you can do and you shouldn't
manually do this. You should just ask
claude to like add these for you. You
know like go back to that principle that
you're no longer m manually maintaining
your work environment. And a good
example on what to put here for the post
uh tool use is like you know things like
uh our like linting and and formatting
your code and things like that. And I'm
not really using this yet but basically
uh this is really good if you want to
block like removing your entire like
database or something like that. It's
just like good good to prevent very
destructive things. I haven't really set
it up because you know I have like
remote backups and also this is like
side projects but for real work you
probably want something. And finally
with that I think you got the vast
majority of like the best tips that I
know for clock code. Um the last thing
I'll leave it with you is to explore the
like the plug-in ecosystem. All a
plug-in is is a just a combination of
any of these composable things that I
talked about like a skill that triggers
an MCP that triggers like sub agents or
something like that or maybe there's
like a bash script that's attached to a
skill that can all be turned into a
plugin and then a lot of people share
their plugins online. So this is like a
really good example. You know, Anthropic
has their own like plugins like
structure and they have a bunch of
plugins here that you could download.
for example, um like colon ISP and
things like that. So that's basically
it. And the last thing I want to say is
[music] context is king. You got to keep
it fresh, keep it relevant. You
essentially need to give Claude the
context that it needs and nothing more.
But yeah, so go and build something
amazing. I hope this was valuable to
you. I hope you learned something. go
and build something amazing. And if
you're interested in this kind of video
on cog code, I did a whole video on like
kind of the highle thought process of
like AI coding and and also talked a
little bit about my second brain thing.
Those two videos are right here. So go
and check it out. But yeah, until I see
you guys on the next video. Bye.
