Well hello there so back in
january the creator of cloud
code boris chenry he
actually posted about
his entire workflow and i
actually had a chance to
meet with him and ask him
a bunch of questions
and i personally found his
personal workflow very
enlightening and i've been
trying to replicate a lot of
his workflows directly
into mine
so today i thought it'd be
fun to go over this chain of
thread posts that he made
and also kind of show you
physically what it actually
looks like in practice.
Now, I have a few
local projects.
They're nothing really in
terms of complexity as my
projects for work, but I
thought it would actually
work pretty well to kind of
showcase some of these and
kind of like interact with
some of them right here.
So as usual, I created a little
slide deck, so let's get right
into it. So this is
Boris Chenry. For each
of these, I'm just going to
read it out really quick,
show you each of the tips.
Hi, I'm Boris and I created
Cloud Code. Lots of people
have asked how I use
Cloud Code, so. I wanted to
show off my setup a bit.
My setup might be
surprisingly vanilla.
Cloud Code works great out
of the box, so I personally
don't customize it much.
There is no
one correct way to use
Cloud Code. We intentionally
build it in a way that you
can use it, customize it,
and hack it however
you like. Each person on
Cloud Code team uses it
very differently, so here goes.
I really like how he set up
here that Cloud. Code can
be customized. I personally
have been customizing the
hell out of it, and at some
point I'll probably share my
own personal setup as well,
but I really like how it
starts out here.
So let's get to the first tip.
The first tip is around
running clouds in parallel.
I run five clouds in parallel in
my terminal. I numbered my
tabs one through five and
use system notifications to
know when a cloud
needs input. So look at this.
I will open up my terminal.
All right, so it looks like what
he does is he creates a cloud
like this.
And then he has one that is
just for like,
just a terminal for bash.
So it looks like this is
a setup.
And then he has multiple
tabs like this. And then he
probably replicates this cloud
tab system
for all of them, right? Now I
actually work very similarly
like this. I'll have one
instance here,
one instance there. I'm using
like hotkeys. For iTerms it's
command two,
command three,
command four to
switch between. And then
you could switch in between
the tabs by doing command
left bracket or
right bracket. Now one
additional tip here that I
like to do to keep things like
in my mental context is to
like rename it. So this could
be like
local one,
or maybe the project that
I'm working on local.
This is push to prod
app, for example.
And then here,
maybe instead of this,
I work on my anime
Pomodoro app, for example.
And because I did that, I will
name this local anime.
Now you could imagine that
you would have like SSH or
some kind of on-demand
stuff as well. And this is
exactly what I do at work.
So that's tip number one.
It also looks like he uses
light mode. I am not going to
switch my dark mode to
light mode. Okay.
Tip number two is five to 10
web clods.
So
I also run five to 10 clods on
clod.ai slash code in parallel
with my local clods. As I
code in my terminal, I will
often hand off local sessions
to web.
And I will manually kick off
sessions in Chrome.
And sometimes I will teleport
back and forth.
I also start a few sessions for
my phone from the clod iOS
app every morning and
throughout the day and
check in on them later.
So this is clod.ai and I
actually haven't done the
teleport feature,
but let's try the teleport.
I don't know if it will work,
but for my
push to prod app, let's work
on some of the
printify integrations. Give me
a plan. So it looks like it's
whatever sessions are
on here. It just
maintains here, but let me
see if. I can do a slash
teleport. I'm just going
to try. Can you,
can you
push to
the web?
I shall teleport.
I'm just going to try this.
Okay. This is taking a
long time. I'm just going to
cancel this and
create
to dues for print to
buy integrations. Okay. So it
looks like it's creating a
background task.
Look at this right here.
So you just hit and like this
and then, um, it creates a
session and then you can
basically open the session
like so,
and it's going right here.
That's really cool. I actually
haven't been using this, but I
can imagine doing this,
especially when I'm like
ready to go off for the day
or something like that.
And it's synced to
your phone. If you look
at this,
it's synced.
So, so you can start new
sessions here. So
I actually didn't know
about this, but this is
actually mind blowing to me.
That's awesome. I'm going to
start using this all the time.
Okay.
Next tip. Tip number three
is Opus with thinking always.
I use Opus 4.5 with thinking
for everything. It's the best
coding model I've ever used.
And even though it's bigger
and slower than Snonit,
since you have to steer it
less and it's better at
tool use, it's almost always
faster than using a smaller
model in the end. Now he
posted this before Opus 4.6
came out. So I wonder what
he's thinking about it now,
because Opus is like known to
be a lot slower.
So one thing you can do is
you can switch though,
like this.
Oh, so using slash model
and I actually also just
default to 4.6. They got rid
of ultra think,
which used to have this little
like animation thing, but,
and if you have like just
multiple like sessions of cloud
code going, then it doesn't
matter if it's that slow in
my opinion, right?
Tip number four is share
your cloud.md.
One cloud.md for the whole
team checked into the Git.
Update multiple times
a week. Okay. Our team
shares a single cloud.md for
the cloud code repo.
We check it into Git and the
whole team contributes
multiple times a week.
Anytime
we see cloud do it,
do something incorrectly,
we add it to the cloud.md.
So cloud knows not to do
it next. Our team maintains
their own cloud.mds. It's, it is
each team's job to keep
theirs up to date. Now I
actually asked Boris what his
personal cloud.md is.
And he said, there's basically
like two lines and it just
points to, um,
using the cloud.md.
And so, so the whole idea is
that they're doing compound
engineering and then context
engineering right within the
code base. I have a video
coming up around this on
agentic engineering,
but, but yeah,
it's very simple. I also am
doing this now where,
for example,
like
this Pomodoro app, I have
the cloud.md directly
here. And it's kind of like
things about my code base
for iOS, the navigation flow,
the design patterns and
things like that. A lot of this
stuff you can just create
using slash init. But yeah,
Like this is like very
straightforward stuff.
All right.
Tip number five is
add Claude in code reviews.
So during code review, I will
often tag add Claude on my
coworkers PRs and add
something to Claude.md as
part of the PR.
We use Claude code, get up
action slash install get up
action for this. It's our
version of at. Dan shippers
compound engineering.
Now, so I actually kind of
set this up. So you can
see that
like right there,
Claude's there in
this workflow.
Um, let me try, try making
a quick PR, write me a
quick PR
on some of these to do's and
push it as a
separate branch. So the
whole idea is that you
should theoretically, once this
pushes do an at, and then
do a review. Now,
obviously this is like not a
good example that I'm doing
because it's just to do's.
But theoretically the whole
idea is you develop a system
so that it automatically uses
Claude to review your diffs
or do other actions.
Tip number six is plan
mode first.
Most sessions start in
plan mode, shift tap twice.
If my goal is to write a
pull request, I use plan mode
and go back and forth with
Claude until I like his plan.
From there, I switch it into
auto accept edits mode and
Claude can usually
one-shot it. A good plan is
really important.
So I, I also do plan mode all
the time as well.
So for example, here, I want
to create a new live activity
for my anime Pomodoro app,
where it
keeps tracks of the timer in
my like live activity and also
dynamic Island. All right.
There's something definitely
wrong with this UI here,
but it's going. So I really like
plan mode, because it's a
way to really
analyze and deep dive into
your code base before you
actually make any changes.
Someone asked me recently,
why do you even have
multiple cloud instances?
What are you doing?
A lot of times, if I'm not
using Git work trees, or like
some way to do multiple
coding executions,
I'm actually doing a lot of
deep dives using plan mode
for like different parts of
the code base. So maybe I
have like some kind of
performance optimization
project I want to do on
media viewer, maybe I want
to do look into app in it
or app
star, whatever I'm trying
to investigate, I actually use
plan mode. And also for
like investigating. SEVs or
investigating like
random bugs, I'll also start
with plan mode to
start investigating. And plan
mode is essentially a way for
you to create
prompts like
gigantic prompts,
like really good
prompts. And I talked about
context engineering and
things like that. But plan
mode is where you
do the orchestration to be
able to bring all the context
that you need into that
Cloud instance so that the
agent can execute correctly.
All right, tip number seven,
slash commands
for everything.
I use slash commands for
every inner loop workflow
that I do many times a day.
This saves me from repeated
prompting and makes it so
Cloud can use these
workflows too.
Commands are checked into
the Git and live in .cloud
slash commands.
For example, Cloud and I use
a slash commit dash push
dash PR slash command
every day.
The command uses
inline bash
to precompute Git status to
make the command run
quickly and avoid back and
forth with the model. Okay,
so if you ever wonder how
you want to make a slash
command, it's very,
very easy to do.
So let's just go here and say
I want to create a commit
dash push dash PR skill.
And this skill needs to
format my code and then
add everything that I just
did in the session and then
commit the code
with a good
commit message. I always
want to push it as a PR
rather than directly as main
so that I can review the
code online,
something like that.
And these days, actually,
slash commands and skills
are basically the same.
So Cloud will usually create
the same thing now.
You know, the thing about
making these videos is that
it just takes a long
time because. Cloud takes a
long time to run.
I probably should have ran
this on Sonnet, but it's okay.
Opus is fine.
But you can see here that
it's exploring the skills first so
that it's not remaking the
same thing.
And I love the fact that
Cloud Code and Codex,
they
ask questions rather
than just
assuming.
And I think this is like a big
change between like,
I don't know. I haven't used
Cursor in a bit. Maybe I
should give it a try.
But I remember it just like
kind of did stuff
without it. Always just
made assumptions,
which and it always turned
out like not great. All right.
It decided to name it
slash ship, which is fine to
me as well. But yeah,
that's how you create skills.
It's very easy. You remember
all you need to do to make
skills or slash commands or
subagents or install MCPs.
It's just leverage Cloud Code
to ask you to do it. All right.
Tip number eight from Boris
is custom subagents.
I use a few
subagents regularly.
Code Simplifier simplifies the
code after Cloud is
done working. Verify app has
detailed instructions for
testing Cloud code end to
end and so on.
Similar to slash commands.
I think subagents is
automating the most
common workflows that I do
for most PRs. Now, one thing
about subagents I want to
say is that it's really to
protect the context.
Subagents are really useful if
you want to do like
side effects
or if you want to just have
the result of that like Cloud
instance running. You don't
really care how it got there,
but you just want
the output.
That's really good
for subagents. There's a
new thing. This that just
came out with Opus 4.6
called Agent Swarm or
Agent Teams. And I'll
probably do a video on this,
but it's the idea of
subagents that have actually
different roles and they
share context with
each other. And there's like
a master orchestrator.
I think in my other video,
I show what a subagent is,
but
I should have some
subagents here.
Agents you can see here.
I actually have
I created the same ones that
Boris made because I
thought it was
very interesting. Yeah,
so I could just say
right here in
another instance. Can you
run my code architecture
subagent to verify the
integrity of my build or
integrity of my app? I don't
know about you guys, but I
run out of RAM all the time
at work.
I think
one, my code base is
extremely large.
And then I also have like five
or so cloud instances running
all the time.
Um, I had to give up running
Android studio completely or
like I just had my
terminal up. I don't even
have Chrome up sometimes
when I'm running out
of memory.
So yeah.
So you can see that it's
running two agents here.
Let's do control O to expand
it and just see what it's
doing. Yeah.
Code architecture
is reviewing.
I don't know. All of this stuff
is so cool to me.
Okay so while that's all going
let's go back all right post
tool use hooks i don't know
why it's hard to say but we
use a post tool use hook to
format cloud codes cloud
usually generates well
formatted code out of the
box and the hook handles
the last 10 to avoid
formatting errors in ci later
this one there's not much to
show you can create one
just saying post tool use and
it's very similar to like
pre-commit hooks. It's
nothing new here.
All right, slash permissions
and not dangerously skip.
Number 10,
I don't use dangerously
skip permissions. Instead, I use
slash permissions to
pre-allow common bash
commands that I know are
safe in my environment.
To avoid unnecessary
permission problems, most of
these are
checked into
.cloud slash
settings.json and shared with
this team. This is what I
talk about like in compound
engineering where this you
need to like
start putting things like this
into the code base and share
with the team. A
team needs to be
like AI native first and
everyone has to kind of
start agreeing on some of
these these like ways that
we need to work and that's
how you really move quickly.
But yeah, so quickly showing
you guys you can do slash
permissions here
and then yeah
slash permissions. There's a
bunch of things
here and. I would just say
you can update
this manually, right?
Can you update my
permissions list so that all
bash scripts are okay
to run?
For example, you could do
that like
I keep saying this but don't
manage your clock code
instance manually,
you know, just have clock
code do it and then after
you do this, you can always
push all of this directly into
the code base. You see it's
trying to change the settings
right now. All right,
while that's going,
tip number 11, MCP for
all tools. Slack,
entry, cloud uses your tools,
not your code base. 11,
clock code uses all my tools
for me. It often searches
and posts to Slack via the
MCP server, run BigQuery
questions to answer
analytic questions
using a BigQuery CLI,
grabs error logs from century
and Slack MCP configurations
is checked into our
MCP JSON
and shared with teams.
Now, I always say be careful
with MCPs because they're.
They're known to blow up
your like context window,
only leverage it when you
need it for a very
specific things. If you see
what these are, these are
very like outside of the norm
of regular coding
and even like Slack, right?
Like this is, so we have this
integration similar to our
internal
communication channel.
And I use this as a, with a
combination of our like PR
reviewing thing,
where I'll just
pull all of my context from
the PRs, read the diffs that I
wrote this week. And then I'll
have it summarize that.
And then like send status
reports to like specific
threads that I want.
So using cloud code to
manage your work besides
just coding is like a whole
like big thing. Now there's
not much to show here,
but for MCPs, you should
always just kind of be
careful because I think like
MCP is also another place
where prompt injection is
going to start happening.
Same thing with
downloading plugins and
stuff like that. I think just
be careful when you're doing
these and just always have
cloud code review the MCP
before you install it. Okay,
for number 12,
long running tasks.
For very long running tasks,
I will either prompt cloud to
verify its work with the
background agent when
it's done.
Use agent stop hook to do
that more deterministic
or use Ralph Wiggin plugin.
I will also use either
permission mode equals
don't ask
or dangerously skip.
And sandbox to avoid
permission prompts for
the sessions.
So cloud isn't blocked on me.
So now I don't really use
dangerously skip too often
or even Ralph Wiggin.
Tried ralph again
ralph is this right so this is
the ralph we can loop
basically you just have a
task you have the agent you
have the file system and
then it just keeps looping
until it's finished i don't
really like this because i feel
like there's
it's too i don't know there's
just so much
uh work that needs
to happen
for you to have like a spec
that's like so perfect that
you can just have something
like ralph build the whole
thing but honestly for side
projects and things like that
i might just spec the whole
thing out and i don't really
care too much
and it's it's okay to let it
run uh overnight or
whatever and it's okay and
the whole idea is like you do
it a few times maybe and
then get a different result
every single time
and then you kind of test
out if it's good and then you
could throw it away and
then start engineering i
think there are times when
it's actually pretty good.
I think the hype around it
has died
quite a bit. But yeah, like if
you want to use it, I'm not
going to show how to use
it here. But you just install
the plugin that I showed you
earlier and then just start
installing it. But to do
dangerously skip permissions,
it's very easy to do that.
So for example,
when you're here,
let's exit here.
When you do a cloud,
you can do
just a cloud dangerously
skip permissions
like
that. And then now when
you ask cloud to
run something, it won't ask
you any permissions.
Basically, it's okay. 13,
a final tip, probably the
most important thing to
get good, great results out of
cloud code, give cloud a way
to verify his work. If cloud
has that feedback loop,
it will three two to three x
the quality of final
results. Cloud tests every
change I land in cloud.ai
slash code using the
Chrome extensions,
It opens the browser,
tests the UI, and iterates
until it works.
So let's give this a try.
Can you run an end-to-end
integration test navigating
the website from the
homepage to
the detail page? When you
click on a poster, make sure
the title is the same. Okay,
so
it just launched the website.
I'm gonna try to show it.
Okay, there you go.
Check that out. Okay, so it
navigated to the
main website. All right,
so now it went into the
detail page
and it's clicking on stuff.
You can see that it's like
taking screenshots and stuff.
It's very cool.
And this is kind of this
agentic validation thing that
I'm talking about in one of
my other videos. And look,
it passes, it like tells you
what it did.
Very, very cool. And this is
like a different form of end-to-end,
right? It's not, it's, I didn't
like write an end-to-end
test
per se, right? It just kind of
knew how to do it
and navigate. You can do
really a lot of interesting
things here.
So that's Boris Chenly's
workflow. I hope you guys
enjoy this. I think one of the
really interesting things is
that if you think about
what your work might have
looked like
six months ago, and then
you compare it to like
Boris's workflow,
it's probably like night
and day, right? We were
still manually coding at
that point, but now we
have like multiple
clock code instances
just going at all times,
multiple clock code instances.
And you're just like playing
StarCraft over here,
you know,
basically saying, hey, file this
PR over here.
And then you go to the next
one and then you go down
and go, oh, update my
like backlog task or fix
this bug
and you switch over.
Now, I know probably
this is content, right?
Context switching wise,
mentally, it's probably the
bottleneck at this point.
And these little quick
prompts that I'm doing is
obviously not ideal,
but you should really
challenge yourself to try to
like take some of the
learnings here.
Try it yourself.
Like one thing I'm gonna do
this week is definitely figure
out how to do the teleport
things more often.
Obviously I can't do it for
my work because we don't
have slash teleport yet,
but for my
personal products, I could
just see myself doing this.
And I wanna build like a
entire agentic validation
on GitHub, so that I can just
do clock code sessions on my
phone and actually code.
You know, I did a video
around kind of trying to do
this with Happy,
but in that workflow,
it's very hard to test
the flow.
But with GitHub Actions,
if it can actually navigate
the web and send me like
a gift
of
like what it did, then it
makes me feel a lot
more safe.
And I just know that it's
validated itself using
screenshots and stuff
like that.
But yeah, I hope you guys
enjoyed this video on
Boris Chenry's, clock code
set up
and go and check out my
other clock code videos and
my engineering videos.
And until I see you guys on
the next one, bye.
