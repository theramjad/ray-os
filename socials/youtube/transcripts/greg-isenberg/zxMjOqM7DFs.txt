So, you want to use Claude Code. You
want to get the most of it, but you
don't know exactly how. This is a crash
course how to master Claude Code, and we
explain it in the most simple way. There
are thousands, literally thousands
[music] of other Claude code tutorials
on the internet, but there are none as
simple as this. I brought on Professor
Ross Mike. He comes on and he shares it
in the simplest way so that anyone could
create jawdropping
startups and software using cloud code.
We're going to give you the exact steps
[music]
for how you can set it up, thinking
about the beginner, how to think about
[music] the terminal, how to think about
prompting. But if you stick around to
the end of this episode, there's a tips
and tricks section, which I think is
super valuable. And uh I can't wait to
see what you build.
>> [music]
[music]
>> We got Ross Mike on the pod. By the end
of this episode, what are people going
to learn?
>> Hopefully, you're going to not feel
overwhelmed with claude code. I know the
terminal is scary and it's a big
boogeyman, but I'm going to give you the
blueprint, how to use it. I'm also going
to share, consider this the ultimate
crash course on how to use Claude Code
or any agent effectively.
Okay, let's let's get into it.
>> So, I mean the best way to start these
episodes is with sharing our screen. So,
when we think of building applications
using AI, using some sort of agent like
cloud code or open code or codec,
whatever it is, there's a couple of
things that you always have to keep in
mind. You know, the principles never
really change. One thing that it's
important for us to understand is
however good your inputs are will
dictate how good your output is. Right?
We're getting to a point where the
models are so freakishly good that if
you are producing quote unquote slop,
it's because you've given it slop,
right? Um there was a time where the
models weren't good enough. There was a
time where, you know, we had serious
qualms and issues with the quality of
code the models gave us. But now we're
starting to get to a point where even
myself like I'm reviewing a lot more
code than I write. And I never thought
I'd be able to say that in the early uh
months of 2026. So very important for us
to understand our inputs, how good they
are, how precise they are, how
articulate they are are just as good as
our outputs and will dictate just how
good our outputs will be. And the way I
want people to think about this is Greg
is like imagine you were communicating
this to a human to a human engineer,
right? If you give them sparse
instructions and if anyone is in like
client work, you realize that most
clients they they they tell you one
thing but you have to sort of extract
the deeper thoughts of what it is they
want. Um it's the same way when we work
with these agents. When we work with
claude code, we need to be really really
precise with how we build our inputs.
Now, what do I mean by inputs? What I
mean is our PRDS or our to-do list or
our plans, right? Like there's, you
know, people are giving you different
names. Um, it doesn't really matter.
It's all the same thing, right? And when
we think of a PRD or when we think of a
to-do list or when we think of a plan, I
want us to think in such a way as this.
Let's say I'm trying to build this
product, right? Let's say um I don't
know, Greg, any product ideas um that
>> me have product ideas?
>> Yeah, that's actually the best best
person to ask, right? [laughter]
Um let's say I go on idealbrowser.com
and
>> I was just going to it. I was just going
to it. Yeah, pick pick the idea of the
day from idea browser. Says it's a
diagnostic tool for appliance text
losing hundreds of repeat visits. See, I
have no idea what that means, but let's
say I know what that means. Essentially,
when thinking of this idea and looking
to build this into a full-fledged
product, generally the way you're going
to think is, okay, if the if product X
does Y, Z, A, B, and C, how I would
reach that is I'm going to think of
features, right? So, let's say there's
four core features to this application
that um Greg just mentioned. And if I
have these four features built out, we
can safely assume that we have said
product, right? The way we are to design
our PRDs, to-do lists, and plans is such
that we want the agent, the model to
build out all these features, right?
Because all these features put together
is our product. You see, a lot of times
people will describe a product, um, not
describe features, and will be
frustrated with AI. Like AI is supposed
to magically know what you're thinking
about. Um, by the way, Greg, am I making
sense so far, or am I
>> 100% I'm with you.
>> Yeah. So, we really need to think in
features. But here's the cool part. When
developing features, often times the
issue with models is like you'll develop
a feature or like let's say the model
develops a feature. We don't know if it
works. We don't know if it did it the
right way. That's where with all the
cool Ralph stuff that's happening, we
can introduce tests, right? So let's say
uh the model the agent bu builds feature
one. Before moving on moving on to
feature two, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to get the model to write a test.
If that test passes, then we'll work on
the second feature. If that test passes,
we work on the third feature. Right? So
we're finally entering an era where you
can really build something serious with
these models. So, instead of telling you
about just uh planning, why don't we do
actual planning together? So, I'm going
to pop up my terminal. So, I know
everyone's afraid of the terminal, but
in all honesty, if you don't know how to
use a terminal, ask AI. Like, it's the
like simplest thing. And if not, you can
even download the Cloud Code app and go
on code section, give it a specific
folder you want to work on and use the
app. Like, there's literally no excuse
to not use cloud code. If you're afraid,
boohoo, just jump into use AI. have all
the tools. That being said, I'm just
going to type in Claude and we're going
to have uh Claude code open. And usually
how people plan is they'll click shift
tab, right? And then you have plan mode
on and you can say, let's say I want to
build
um Tik Tok UGC
generating app for my marketing agency.
I see like these UGC apps everywhere.
Um, please help me create a plan. Write
this in the
in uh PRD.MD
file. So, this is how most people have
planning set up, right? you'll tell
Claude Code or Cursor or whatever agent
uh to do the plan for you and you ask it
to be in some file and like it says it'd
be happy to help you plan this out and
it'll ask you some questions etc etc.
But I found that there's a better way to
get an even more concise plan. And this
way it actually gets you to think a lot
more about tradeoffs, concerns, UIUIUX
decisions because most of the time
you're sort of allowing the AI to have
free reign over certain decisions which
I think uh will lead you with a finished
product that you're not excited about.
And that's invoking a special tool. Um I
was going to show you guys the tweet but
unfortunately Twitter's down right now.
But Claude Code has a specific tool
called ask user question tool. And
essentially what this tool does, it
starts to interview you about the
specifics of your plan. Right? So I'm
going to drop this prompt where it says
read this plan file. Interview me in
detail using the ask user question tool
about literally anything. Technical
implementation, UI, UX concerns, and
trade-offs. I spelled implementation
wrong. Do not judge me. Um, and what
this is going to do is it's going to go
past the plan that we have and start to
ask us about minute details. So, let's
finish off this plan first. I'm just
going to accept um this is internal use
uh text. We'll use React. I just want
core features. We'll submit answers. And
then cloud code, you'll see might ask us
a few more questions, but this will
generally be the plan,
>> right? So it's it's not just it's not
just the plan, it's the right plan,
right? Like to what you were saying like
go back go scroll back up here the
features and yeah the features and test
like the way I think about this and I
don't know if you agree is like if you
ask claude code to build you a car it
doesn't really know what a car is. It
doesn't understand like you need a
steering wheel and a you know a radio
and you need wheels. So the the the hard
part is trying to figure out is
basically explaining what those things
are in a really succinct and clear way.
And that's what this interview is
basically doing. It's it's explaining
each of them and then we're going to
test each of those features. Exactly.
Like think of think of it this like a
simple example. Let's say you ask the AI
agent to build you a specific feature,
right? How is it going to present that
specific feature? Did you want it in a
dashboard? Did you want it to be a
modal? Did did it have to be a separate
page? Like when you don't specify these
minute details, it will make the
assumption for you. And with Ralph loops
and all these type of things, like you
might have a whole application built out
and it's not exactly to the liking or
the expectations you had. Right? So, let
me continue. I'll just make some
selections here just so we can move on.
Um, and then hit submit. And then I'm
going to pause this planning here and
then I'm going to paste this. I'm going
to say read this plan file and I'm going
to tag the plan file. It's called
prd.md.
We have that right here. Um, and I'm
going to say interview me the details
about this question or I don't even need
to tag it because it has it in its
context. But I just want to show you how
annoyingly
uh annoying this is going to get.
Meaning it's going to keep asking me
questions about said plan or said uh app
idea. So notice how it says round one
core workflow and technical foundation,
right? And some of the questions it
might even ask you are things that you
might not know about cuz you're not
technical. So what do I do when I don't
know something, Greg? I'm going to copy
this and I'm going to go to the chatbot
of my choice, whether it's claude, chat,
GBT, whatever, and I'm going to ask it
questions. So if you remember earlier,
it asked me generic questions about the
app. Now it's saying, "What's your ideal
workflow for generating UGC video from
start to finish?"
Like notice how the questions are even
more specific now. So it says linear
stepbystep template based batch
processing iterative conversational. So
let's say I select that and it says how
should the app handle agent API cost and
usage. So now it's talking about cost
right again most of the times when you
just have a basic plan this is not
included in the plan. Right? Let's say
we want to have a hard hard budget. Um
what database and hosting approach do
you want to use? Most of you probably
watching this have no idea. So I can
copy this over, go to Chad GBT and ask
what's the best decision. This is my
current situation. And then you keep
going. You keep going and you submit
answers. So when you use this ask user
question tool, the questions become more
granular. So it asks me about core
workflow and technical foundation. Now
it's going to ask me about UI, UX, and
script generation. If you notice the
first plan that it came up with, the
default plan for claude code, it was
pretty basic. Now it's asking me, okay,
what AI do I want to use for the script
generation? I'll use Claude. Uh, what UI
style aesthetic are you going for?
Minimal clean, dashboard heavy, creative
tool field, chat first. Right. So
hopefully, Greg, I'm making sense with
like how much more questions I'm being
asked when I'm invoking this ask user
question tool.
Yeah, it makes complete sense. You're
also you're also going to use less
tokens in the end, right? Because you're
right.
>> Yeah. Because the thing is the better
your plan, the better your input, the
better the initial set of documents that
you give the model, um the the better
the outcome. And if the better the
outcome, there's no back and forth,
right? Most people will have a Ralph
loop running. It'll be a basic plan and
it'll do what you told it to do, but you
weren't specific. So now you're going
back and then maybe you're running
another loop or you're going back and
doing all these changes. But if you get
it done right, if you invest the time in
the planning stage, I 100% believe
you'll save a lot more money. And this
will help you clear up a lot of ideas.
So like for example, this idea that we
just had, this Tik Tok UGC farm, um, how
do we want it set up? Do we want it to
be flat with search? Do we want it to be
client campaign assets? There's a lot of
like these minute details that you're
not thinking about and because you're
not thinking about it, you're allowing
cloud code to make those assumptions for
you, right? Which at the end after it's
burned through a ton of tokens, now
you're going back to change, right? We
can save so much headache if we do the
proper planning from the beginning. And
hopefully um people see value in this um
ask user question tool. Make sure you
specify it in your prompt. And
hopefully, Greg, that that made sense.
>> It does.
>> So, I would say step number one for this
Claude C crash course is I would get
good at planning. I would get really
really good at planning. I would get
good at generating these, right? Like
look, it it keeps on asking me
questions. If you notice the very first
plan that we generated with Claude, it
was two sets of questions and it was
ready to build. But with this, it's
asking me, do I want basic avatars,
custom avatars, multi-seene videos? How
do I want to handle storage? Do I want
to download the videos instantly? Cloud
storage, external storage, like there's
so much to software engineering. And I
think in our last video, you um someone
shared this on Twitter. I don't know if
it was you or someone else. Like
software um building personal software
is easy, but building software others
are going to use is very, very
difficult. And if you don't have the
audacity or the decency to to set up a
little time, a little extra time to
plan, then I guarantee whatever you
generate is going to be AI slop. And you
might blame the model, but really the
problem is you. So invest in your plans.
Spend time using planning. Um don't use
the generic plan uh mode that cursor or
claude code has. I would use claude
code. And then I would specify the ask
user question tool. um it's going to
continue to know you with questions like
it keeps asking, right? Cuz until it
knows exactly what it is you want, it
won't start building. Um so I would say
that's step number one to building with
cloud code. Step number two, and
everyone's talking about Ralph and it's
exciting. Um but I wouldn't use it. I
wouldn't use Ralph. And the reason I
wouldn't use Ralph if I was just
starting out, Greg, is because um how
are you going to like imagine this, like
imagine not knowing how to drive, but
then buying a Tesla for uh like the
self-driving stuff. Like cool in theory,
but maybe it's a great idea to know how
to drive, how to steer, how to hit the
corners, how to maybe yell at someone
when they cut you off before you get the
full automated version. I say this to
say because when you get good at
developing plans and then working with
the AI to build each feature and testing
each feature, you you start to develop
this sense on product building on on
like you know even uh I heard someone
call vibe QA testing. You get this sense
by going one-on-one yourself. And this
is why a lot of people who were fighting
with claude code all these months are
really really good at using it now
because they spent the time building
without using these crazy automation
loops. So if you're using cloud code for
the first time or you're just getting
into it good plan number one and number
two get your reps in by not using Ralph.
So develop the features one by one. Now
that you have your plan, you can
literally tell Claude Code, hey, okay,
let's build the first feature. Um, you
know, go ahead and do it. And then once
the feature is done, you can test it
out. Ask it, how can I test this? How
can I run this app? I wouldn't jump into
using Ralph right away. Um, build
without Ralph. But let's say you've
built these reps now and you're you're
comfortable with Cloud Code. Now you
hear about all these things. skills MCP
uh prompt MD agent MD um what else is
there something MD you you hear all
these conventions plugins um you have
Ralph all these things so what do I need
to perfectly uh build something um using
cloudc any agent I'll be honest with you
most of these things are all the same
prompt MD and agent MD are just markdown
files um plugins
are skills with you know a little bit
extra. What you need to build
successfully using these agents is first
of all you need a good plan right which
are documents which is the prd we just
generated and then you need um to
document um the progress that's being
made. Um for anyone who's familiar with
for with Ralph you know what I'm talking
about. For those who aren't, what's cool
about a Ralph loop is as follows. A
Ralph loop is basically you have a list
of things that need to be get that need
to get done. Uh the uh whatchamacallit
the prd or the plan you give it to the
AI model. The model works on the first
task. It finishes it then documents it
in another file and then it it goes
again and it stops until it's completed
the whole list. Now, this isn't anything
special, but the reason why it's now
super powerful is because the models are
getting so so good. But here is the
issue. If you have a terrible plan, if
you have a terrible PRD, this doesn't
matter. You're just donating money to
Enthropic and I wish you the best of
luck if that's what you want to do. But
if you want to make sure that your
tokens are not wasted, you're going to
invest in a good PRD. MD file or a good
plan file.
Greg, am I making sense so far?
>> 100%.
>> Okay,
>> you're driving the point home.
>> Yes. So, I'll talk a little bit about um
Ralph uh now. So, with Mr. Ralph Wiggum,
um how do we use this? Now, there's a
lot of different um iterations like
people are coming with their own style.
I'm going to share with you my Ralph
setup in a second. Um Greg, um one thing
I will say is Cloud Code has a plugin, a
Ralph Wigum plugin. I wouldn't use that.
And the reason I wouldn't use that is
even the person who invented the whole
Ralph system um is against it. It's not
the best use of Ralph. But I just want
to share this concept of how Ralph
works. It's essentially going to go
through our plan and it's going to build
out each feature step by step. And it's
not going to stop until it's done. This
is cool when your plan rocks. If your
plan sucks, then it's terrible. It
doesn't matter. Now, in terms of how to
set up um Ralph Wigum, I have my own
setup, and I don't want anyone to think
I'm shilling my own setup for any
reason, but the reason why I built my
own setup is there's a couple things my
Ralph loop does. The first thing is it
makes sure that there's a plan, a prd
file, and there's a progress.txt file.
But it also every feature it builds, it
then writes a test and it then lints.
And basically what this does is it makes
sure that every feature that's built
actually works, right? Cuz there's no
point on working on feature two if
feature one doesn't work. If feature one
doesn't work, if the test fails, guess
what the AI model is going to do? It's
going to go back to working on feature
one. And once the test passes, we work
on feature two. And then once feature
two test passes, we work on feature
three. Right? All this is awesome, but
I'm going to go back to the same point.
If your plan sucks, then the Ralph loop
won't matter. Now, in order to set up
this loop, um you can find the uh get up
here. How to set it up, you honestly,
I'm not even going to explain it. Uh
Greg, people can literally copy the
link, pass it to Claude, and then be
like, I want to run this Ralph loop, and
it will tell you exactly what to do.
That's how good the models have become.
But I'll show you an example of this
running. So I have a simple prd file.
It's nothing crazy. It's just to show
you the point. But basically there are a
couple tasks here. I want to build a
basic server that has some basic
endpoints. And I just want to show you
how my Ralph loop works. So when I run
this Ralph loop and again if you don't
know how to run this the you paste the
GitHub URL in cloud code in your agent
and ask it and it will tell you how to
do it. I have a few different
configurations. I can use open code if I
want. I can use codeex if I want. But
I'm just going to use cloud code. And
I'm just going to run this script. And
basically what it's going to start doing
is it's going to start running through
each task as you can see. And it's going
to update the PRD and it's just going to
continue to work. Now I can go and
leave, right? I can go about my day,
hang with um hang with uh Greg and this
loop will continue to work and I'm going
to see that at some point whether it's 5
minutes, 3 minutes, 10 minutes, however
long this is, this is going to finish
all the tasks. I'm going to have a
working product built and all this is
cool, but it doesn't matter if I'm going
to go back to the original document if
the plan isn't good. Now, skills are
great, MCPs are great, all these
different markdown files are great. You
would do yourself a serious service if
your
if your plan is good. So, the key to
successfully building with cloud code is
you have an absolutely great plan. And
if you use the ask user question tool,
you will spend so much time on the plan
where it starts to get annoying. It
doesn't get fun. But those of us who
focus on this will end up having better
outputs. Um, let's continue. If you
notice here, my Ralph loop is continuing
to go and it took care of the first
task. I can see some files already
generated. If I go to the progress.txt
file, you can see Greg, it's started to
make some progress. It's documenting
that. And this is just going to continue
to work. This is just going to continue
to run. So, people have different
iterations. I know the AMP code people
have their own iteration. Um, and
different people have their own
iteration. It doesn't really matter,
right? Someone's Ralph is could be
better, someone's can be worse,
someone's could be all of that is cool,
but don't get stuck in the weeds. The
main sauce is how you can articulately
perfectly in a beautiful presentation
create the perfect input because if you
create the perfect input, we have
reached a point where the models will
give you perfect output. So that's my
main uh tip crash course for people. Use
the ask user question tool. Build
without using Ralph. And if you are
going to use Ralph, understand if your
plan sucks, you're just donating money
to Anthropic. And I think Anthropic has
enough money that they don't need your
money being donated to them.
>> Amen.
>> Amen. Is there anything else people need
to know? Like little tips and tricks. I
notice you know you're not using the Mac
terminal. You're using ghosty.
>> Yes. Yes. So, honestly, it's all
preference, right? So, like the terminal
you use and all this stuff is all
preference. Here's what I would say.
Like, let's have a tips and tricks list.
Tips and tricks. So, first I would say
is my goodness spelling today. First I
would say is use the ask what was the
specific tool? I just want to make sure
I don't forget. ask user questions tool.
Slept on. I don't know why no one's not
talking about it. It literally I saw the
tweet from the Enthropic team. 100% I
would use that when planning. Uh number
two, um don't over obsess
obsess on uh MCP skills, etc., etc. I'm
not saying don't get into these. I'm not
saying don't read about them. I'm not
saying don't use them. But I I can
almost guarantee you these things are
not the reason why your product isn't
working. Right? Most of the time it's
your plan sucks. Right? That's number
two. Um number three, I would use Ralph
after I've built something without. And
the reason being is again listen if you
are a baller shot caller and you have
all the money to blow and you don't care
and you want to donate money to
Anthropic, go ahead and use Ralph. But
if we were to sit here eye to eye and
you haven't built anything, deployed
anything, there isn't a URL that I
myself or Greg can click on that you've
built, you have no business using Ralph.
You literally have no business using
Ralph. I would first get good at
prompting and building something using a
plan, whether it's whatever AG1, cloud
code, open code, whatever. Once you have
something deployed to Verscell or like
there's a URL and we can use it, then
you can use Ralph. Number four, um this
is a little in the weeds, but context is
more important than ever. And a lot of
times cloud code or even cursor will
tell you what percent of context has
been used. Um I generally wouldn't go
over 50%. Meaning like the enthropic
model opus 4.5 has a 200,000 token
context limit. The moment in my opinion
you've got over a 100,000 tokens meaning
you're using the same session it starts
to sort of deteriorate that's when you
have people Greg who say oh like I
started off good but it started going
bad. That's because you've filled it
with so much context. And the best way
to think about this is like yourself
right? Like let's say we went to some
English class and or some you know
whatever class and the professor just
kept dumping information information at
some point we're going to feel
overwhelmed and we're going to actually
start forgetting stuff um and I'm not
saying that's how the models work but
that's how the models act right so
context is very much important the
moment you see 50% or even 40% I would
start a new session and last but not
least um have audacity and what I mean
by that is software development is
starting to become easy but software
engineering is very very hard and what
do I mean by that? Um to architect
software to make sure things are usable
to create great UX UI to have great
taste to make something that people
actually use requires time and in order
to spend time it requires audacity. I
know the models are good and you can
clone a $6 billion software but if all
of us can do it now what makes software
different I think thinking about those
things and thinking about the art of
building products and building something
that's tasteful is very very important
and I think anyone who uses these five
uh tips should kick cheeks in 2025 2026
sorry
>> um I agree on the audacity thing I think
like it's for me it's like about
creating scroll stopping software
You know what I mean? Like there's so
many people and there's a lot of
tutorials about this like cloning
billion dollar software. You know, I
cloned a $4 billion software. Look at
me. But that's not the type of software
that's going to work in 2026, right? Um
I saw this uh let me just share it real
quick. I saw this guy who created a
running app based on how you're feeling.
So it's like how are you feeling?
Stressed, angry. Um, and it's an AI
assisted running app that interprets
your current emotions to generate a
personalized route. And I just thought
it was interesting, you know what I
mean? Like I had never seen an app like
this. And I think that like as you know,
you call it Audacity. I think this is an
audacious app, right? It's scroll
stopping. You haven't seen it before. So
I think push you want to push Claude
code to like get you to this basically.
And and and this is why I'm like so pro
people not using Ralph if they haven't
built anything fully cuz like now we're
people are getting to a point where they
they want the model to think for them,
right? Where like if you look at the app
you just shared the animations and how
things were floating and like even the
colors used for the different emotions
like that required thought, right? And
that's what stops people now. Like if
building the AI chat interface is easy,
what's going to make your app different?
I think a little bit of audacity, a
little bit of thought and care, and a
little bit of taste goes a long way
nowadays. Um, and more than the models
getting better, cuz it's going to get
easier, it's going to get better, it's
going to get faster. But unfortunately,
if you don't change, then it doesn't all
matter.
>> Yeah. And don't be afraid to use pen and
paper. Like this this person literally
just like started sketching out the
features.
>> Yeah.
>> Like how should this thing work?
>> Yeah. How should it feel? Like And I
love it. I love it. Right. And and this
is why the app if I don't know the
metrics, but I'm willing to bet it's
doing really really well because all
this stuff matters. Like we could clone
something like this feature-wise, but
I'm willing to bet like the feel, the
animations, the colors, we would not be
able to get it exactly like this.
>> 100%.
All right, man. Thanks for coming on.
You got me fired up. I actually I didn't
know about that uh interview tool, so
thanks for sharing that with me. Um,
>> yeah, just a heads up, it will ask a lot
of questions. I shared it with a couple
friends and a couple people got annoyed,
but it's worth it, right? Especially if
you wanted to build something end to end
or you're building a very like like very
minute detailed feature, then it's
really really worth it. I wouldn't use
the general plan personally. Um, so just
a heads up, but it's really really worth
it and I would love to hear people's
feedback in the comments.
>> Sounds good. We'll be in the comments.
uh you got to come back on in a few
months or whenever people want you. Uh
it's always an absolute privilege to
have you here. I'll include links where
you can follow uh and you should follow
uh Msia Rasmike. Uh his YouTube channel
is X. I'll include the link to Ralphie.
Even though if you're a beginner, don't
even click that link. I I wouldn't like
I know there's maybe some degenerates
who do, but I highly suggest you don't
because if you haven't even built
without it,
>> then [clears throat] no point.
>> Have some willpower, folks. Come on. You
know, don't click the link. But I'm
putting it in there cuz I want to see
who's tempted and uh thanks again for
coming on. I'll see you uh I'm coming to
Toronto in April, so let's hang out.
>> Well, we'll see. We'll see each other
then. And again, as always, it's a
pleasure. Thank you so much, you know,
for bringing me on.
>> Of course. Later. Have a go one.
