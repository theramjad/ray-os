Okay, so we had a lot of Claude Code updates to go 
through from the last 2 weeks. But before getting  
started, if you want to sign up to my brand new 
free Claude Code newsletter, then that will be  
linked down below. You will get access to a bunch 
of free videos as well about how I'm currently  
using Claude Code and some of my own workflows. 
Okay, now first of all, one of the biggest recent  
changes is they now made it easier to deal with 
git worktrees in Claude Code. So first of all,  
you want to make sure you're on the latest version 
of Claude Code by using claude update. And then  
you can run claude worktree. Or just run claude 
-w and call it whatever you want. So I'm going  
to call it like assistant mode for my application 
HyperWhisper. And this is my own speech-to-text  
application. Anyway, as you can see, now I made 
a brand new worktree and I can have it implement  
one of my specs in an isolated branch. And then 
I can do the exact same thing on the right-hand  
side with another spec that I have. And now I can 
have two features being implemented at the exact  
same time without these two sessions of Claude 
Code interfering with one another. And then I can  
open up a pull request for this later on. Now you 
can take this further and have any subagents in  
Claude Code being able to work in an isolated work 
tree as well. So a good use case here is that,  
for example, with my Claude Code Masterclass, 
which will be linked down below, it is the  
most comprehensive Claude Code class online. If I 
wanted to make like 5 different variations of the  
landing page, then Claude Code main stores certain 
packages for one variation that's required,  
but that's not required for a different variation. 
Or it might delete some components and move  
components around. Having all that implemented in 
the same folder, file structure would get really  
complicated and these different subagents would 
be stepping on each other's toes. So if we go to  
Claude Code and give it a prompt kind of like this 
and tell each subagent to use its own worktree,  
then it will go ahead and do that for us. We can 
add this to the front matter of any agent that we  
always want to work in its own worktree. So for 
example, I could go to this subagent over here,  
just add it right to the top, isolation 
worktree. And then after calling that subagent,  
I can go and see in the .claude-worktrees folder 
for the project, it made agent-a722 blah, blah,  
blah. I can also see the previous changes that 
also happened. And come back to any of these  
worktrees if I were to exit Claude Code and 
just put in the same name of that worktree.  
And bear in mind that now if you do /resume, 
then it will firstly show all the sessions in  
our current worktree. But then we can press Ctrl+W 
to show all worktrees, including the default main  
branch. And then if you try and exit out of that 
session of Claude Code, it will tell you, you have  
three uncommitted files on that worktree. And you 
have the choice of either keeping the worktree or  
deleting it. So I'm going to keep the worktree 
for now so I can come back to it later. Now you  
can also combine worktrees with tmux as well. So 
if you run claude tmux normally, then it won't  
work. But if you run claude worktrees, I'm gonna 
call it like research-tmux, then it will launch  
Claude Code within tmux inside of the folder that 
you're currently in. So you can see this is our  
tmux session name. And the advantage here is that 
I now have many of the benefits of tmux. So if  
you've seen my video from 2 weeks ago about Claude 
Code Teams, if you have that inside of tmux, every  
single team member running in its own split pane. 
But we can also use the benefits of things run in  
the background even if you exit Claude Code. So 
if I give it a research task, so for example,  
my Claude Code Masterclass, if I copy the URL, 
paste into Claude Code and say, "Can you tell  
me why this is the best Claude Code Masterclass 
on the internet right now?" And then press enter.  
If I press Ctrl+B and then press colon, you can 
see at the very bottom over here, it's like in  
this orange section. If I type detach, press 
enter, then it will detach from that session  
of Claude Code that was just running. And then I 
can reattach to it later. And see that Claude Code  
has continued working on it. So if I run the exact 
same command again on the exact same worktree with  
tmux, and now reattaching to session, I can then 
see that Claude Code went ahead and completed the  
research task in the background. Now, of course, 
you could have done these things before Claude  
Code added this functionality, but these commands 
basically just make the whole process of using  
it much easier. Because if you use it with tmux, 
then you can have long-running background agents,  
for example. If you want to do some testing, then 
you can basically do that in a worktree and not  
worry about it affecting any other tasks that 
are currently running. And if it goes sideways  
or like it doesn't work properly, then you can 
basically destroy that worktree by exiting out of  
the session and using that command. You can have 
different features being implemented in parallel.  
And the key benefit here is that firstly, for 
example, if you use plan mode with Claude Code,  
then Claude Code establishes, okay, we gotta find 
this file in this part of the codebase, this file  
in this other part of the codebase. But if you had 
3 sessions of Claude Code, all editing the same  
file structure without worktrees, then one could, 
make a change or move a file around. And then the  
other two sessions would be confused being like, 
okay, wait, this like suddenly changed. But by  
having it in separate work trees, the file 
structure stays constant until that thing has  
been implemented. And then you can commit that as 
a PR to merge into a main branch. You can also do  
like random investigations or testing with Claude 
Code in a work tree and throw that away later.  
That includes like running a full test suite, for 
example. You can prepare a brand new PR without  
stashing and switching. So for example, if you're 
working on a, like a big task and a colleague asks  
you to like make a quick change, you can just spin 
that up in a new session of Claude Code inside a  
worktree and then update that PR, for example. And 
speaking of which, there is a brand new command,  
which is called --from-pr. So you can put in a PR 
ID. So let me make a new PR. I can then say I now  
have a conversation linked to this PR. Going to 
from-pr, typing in sim-1, I can then load in that  
previous conversation that just happened. That was 
linked to that PR. So that's like an easier way of  
basically finding previous sessions from Claude 
Code. You can do the thing that I showed before  
where you can have different subagents implement 
different solutions without interfering with  
each other, installing different packages, 
removing different packages and so forth,  
and then make a brand new PR from whichever 
subagent solution that you like the most. So that  
makes experimentation much easier. Like I showed 
with the early example of having different landing  
pages being created in different worktrees. And 
finally, you can now hook into worktree events  
with worktree create and remove, which basically 
allows you to do things like installing packages,  
uh, which may not be installed in some cases, 
injecting any config or like adding anything to  
environment variable files so the worktree could 
actually run locally if you require environment  
variables for it to run locally. And with worktree 
remove, once a worktree is deleted, you can stop  
any Docker instances that were created for that 
worktree, and delete any temporary databases,  
caches, or files. If you do wanna learn more 
about hooks, and I do cover that in my Claude  
Code Masterclass in a whole new section about 
hooks, it will be linked down below. Okay,  
now in a limited research preview, Claude Code 
added the ability to have it automatically scan  
your codebase and find security vulnerabilities. 
So they said that using Claude 3.5 Sonnet,  
they found over 500 vulnerabilities in open 
source codebases. Bugs that had gone undetected  
for decades despite years of expert review. Now, 
unfortunately I did not get early access to it,  
but this is kind of what it looks like behind the 
scenes. And I imagine they're using a different  
model in this version of Claude Code compared to 
the one like on your computer, probably using a  
model that is less restricted when it comes 
to like identifying security vulnerabilities,  
which means I can probably identify more of them 
compared to you just having a security tester  
subagent inside of Claude Code itself. Because 
this kind of stuff is a double-edged sword,  
like the better the model gets at hacking, 
the better it gets at— identifying security  
vulnerabilities. Now they did add a bunch more 
features to Claude Code desktop application,  
the biggest of which is previews where Claude Code 
can run a website locally and then click through  
it to make sure that everything works as intended 
and take screenshots along the way. So let's  
quickly test it out. So clicking over here, you 
want to switch to local and you can see they added  
the work tree functionality to desktop application 
too. And then choose your folder and I'm going  
to do— auto accept edits, and then say, can you 
go to a landing page of the Next.js application  
after running the server locally and then test 
it to make sure all the buttons work as intended.  
And then if you click the button on the top right 
where it says preview, press setup, then it will  
start setting up a development server. And you can 
see we kind of have a browser-like functionality  
over here. And it also passed a command telling it 
how to set up a development server automatically.  
And this launch.json file will be saved for the 
future if you commit it to GitHub. So it will be  
faster spinning up the environment in the future. 
Anyways, we can now see which server we need  
set up. So we're gonna choose Next.js only. And 
then you can see it navigates to that particular  
website server, except it's kind of misplaced 
over here. And then I can see the logs at the  
very bottom for the server. And you can see it's 
still clicking around to make sure buttons work.  
I can switch it to a mobile device. So I can ask 
it to make sure that everything works well on the  
mobile as well. And then I can select a particular 
element. So let me just stop it from doing what  
it's doing. Select this element, for example, 
over here. And then it kind of like attach the  
image with the class ID as well and say, change 
this to a green button, press enter. And now this  
button is green. So this can be pretty handy for 
design-related work and also getting Claude Code  
to click around and behave like a user for you to 
make sure things work as intended. So I can also  
do persist sessions as well so that any cookies 
and local storage will be saved across server  
restarts, which can be pretty handy to prevent 
it logging in every time. And then I can do the  
reverse where I clear the session data so it 
will log in again. And now if I allow Claude  
Code to make a PR, in addition to viewing the 
PR, I can see any CI monitoring and I can set  
up like auto fix, which basically means that any 
commands that have failed with the CI monitoring,  
it will automatically identify them and then fix 
them. And then doing auto merge, like once all  
the CI commands have passed successfully, then it 
will do the merge for me. Now if you did make a  
change in the Claude Code CLI and you wanted to 
move over to desktop app, to take advantage of  
the newer features like the element picker, then 
you can do /desktop in the CLI. It will then load  
that session into desktop app and then you can 
continue previewing it and stuff. They now also  
made it easier to view diffs on the desktop app. 
So you can press the view diff button over here,  
the like line count, and then you can see all 
the changes that were made and anything that  
was removed. You can click the plus icon on any 
line and then enter in a comment and then submit  
that comment over to Claude Code. So we'll make 
those changes. So this can mean that you no longer  
need to use VS Code or Cursor just to view diffs 
because you can do that in the Claude Code desktop  
app by doing /desktop to move the session over and 
then you can view the diffs on there. The desktop  
app now supports SSH connections. So you can go 
here, add SSH connection. And let me add one of my  
Hetzner servers. So if I fill in all the details 
over here, add SSH connection, connect. Then I  
can see it's now connected. So I can go over here 
and choose any remote folders from the server. So  
I have this folder over here and then say, can 
you make it a light theme and then redeploy the  
application? And then this will basically connect 
Claude Code to server and have it running on  
there. And this can save you a bunch of hassle 
in doing very quick commands on servers with  
Claude Code. So often I just have very tiny side 
projects hosted for me and my friends online, uh,  
that I use Claude Code to help manage. And if the 
projects are small enough, then I just get Claude  
Code to make it directly on the server. And don't 
bother using Git or anything else. So now claims  
to have made all the changes. So let me refresh 
application. And yeah, it seems to be working  
just fine. We also now have support for plugins 
on the desktop application. So go into plugins.  
I can see that I already have one installed, 
which is a CodeSimplifier one. I can then press  
add to add a plugin. So I'm going to choose the 
frontend design plugin, which is pretty popular  
and install just for the project. And of course, 
when looking through plugins, I can see exactly  
what they contain. They now made it easy to share 
Claude Code sessions via the desktop application  
and the website. So you can make a public link 
and then share it to any colleagues. They added  
a default skill called /debug, and you can put 
in any issues that you observed with Claude Code,  
and it'll basically figure out why that issue 
is happening using the logs that are stored in  
your .claude folder in your root directory. So 
for example, if you're just coding with Claude  
Code and you noticed a hook that you had set up 
did not trigger properly, you can just say like,  
Why did this recent hook not trigger for like 
blocking migrations? And then after you identified  
the problem and you fixed it, you can then rewind 
the session to before you gave this particular  
command by doing /rewind. And just before that 
command, it was commit push over here. Restore  
conversation. Likewise, if you do /rewind, you can 
now select a point and do a summarize from here.  
So Claude Code will summarize a conversation, 
kind of like the /compact command up until that  
point and then start a brand new conversation. So 
just pressing enter, it will compact it and then  
restart a brand new chat. The ask user question 
tool in Claude Code can now display markdown.  
So if I say something like, can you suggest 4 
different orders for the FAQ and how it should be  
displayed on the landing page? Show me a markdown 
of how it works, use the ask user question tool.  
So often that will happen automatically, but I'm 
just trying to force it to happen for the sake  
of demonstration. So it kind of looks like this. 
If you remember previously, the ask user question  
tool did not have this section over here, the 
right-hand section. But now if I switch between  
it, I can kind of see a few different options for 
how it should look. Unfortunately, it's kind of  
cut off at the bottom over here. So if I zoom 
out, then I can see like more of how this would  
be. So if you have a bigger monitor, that would be 
helpful. So if— let's say I wanted to go for this  
two-column approach, I would press N and then I 
can add in any notes. So say swap the columns and  
then press enter and then it will start doing 
that. So you can ask for like tiny mockups,  
uh, in the ask user question tool for how things 
should be laid out. The recently acquired Bun team  
have been making a bunch of memory improvements 
to Claude Code. So they say that the Bash tool  
runs much faster and uses less memory. So on the 
desktop version of Claude Code, you can use your  
slash commands and skills. So I can use my spec 
developer slash command. And now you can do the  
same thing on the web version of Claude Code. 
So typing it out, I can see all the ones that  
I have over here. Let's do spec developer again. 
And that will load the skill that I have in this  
particular project. So this can be slightly better 
for interfacing with your skills if you don't like  
using the CLI. On the web version of Claude 
Code, there is now multi-repo support. So I  
can add another repository over here. And then 
I can do like cross-repo work. So for example,  
I can say something like, copy the design of the 
FAQ part of the master Claude Code landing page  
to the HyperWhisper application. And pressing 
Enter, I can see that I now have two repos that  
are going to be cloned. And it's gonna like do the 
cross-repo work. So I usually find this most handy  
when it comes to comparing two different repos to 
see how an implementation differs, or sometimes I  
find a better implementation for something and 
I want it quickly copied over from one project  
to another one. They now added support for using 
plan mode from the Claude Slack application. So  
you can @Claude and then say, "Can you plan some 
color scheme changes for the landing page?" And  
then you can basically collaborate with your team 
on coming up with a plan for how something should  
be implemented. And finally, they added two more 
things to frontmatter of Subagents. So if you do  
background: true, then that subagent will always 
run in the background. So you can see I just  
triggered the subagent. It's now running in the 
background. And I can actually kill all background  
agents by doing Ctrl+F twice. So Ctrl+F twice, 
all background agents killed. So that's also a  
new command. And subagents now also have memory. 
So that can be on the user level, project level,  
or local level. So that means that if you want 
a subagent to remember things from the previous  
time it had ran, Then you can do like memory. So 
user, project, or local. So let me do project in  
this particular case. Ctrl+Save. And you may 
want to update the prompt for the subagent to  
tell it to make use of its memory or just tell it 
directly when you're triggering it. So I can say,  
can you tell the subagent to basically write a 
poem into its memory? So in this particular case,  
the subagent declined the request for some reason. 
So I'll tell it to write something else. And then  
once the subagent has finished writing something 
into its memory, You can see there's a new agent  
memory folder in the .claude folder for the 
project with the name of the agent. So macOS  
Log Analyzer, and this is its own memory.md file, 
which is injected into the subagent every time it  
runs. So this can solve the issue of having 
subagents remember something previously they  
did the last time they ran. But you may have 
to change your prompt for the subagent to tell  
it to make better use of this. For whatever 
functionality you've given the subagent. So  
combining it with background true, you could 
have like self-improving, self-iterating,  
uh, background research subagents, for example. 
Anyways, that's everything for the video. If you  
are interested in my Claude Code newsletter, then 
that will be linked down below. And you can also  
check out my Claude Code masterclass that goes 
through pretty much every single feature of Claude  
Code. Many people have taken the class and have 
gone on to be the best Claude Code users at their  
company and have even gotten promoted because of 
their newly learned Claude Code skills. Many of  
the biggest companies in the world are already 
using Claude Code and expecting proficiency in  
Claude Code to be a given like nowadays. I also 
recently added a class where I go through my own  
workflows or what I'm doing day to day when 
it comes to using Claude Code. And I will be  
updating over time on a month by month basis so 
you get a sense of what I'm currently doing and  
how I'm making use of many of the features that I 
have described to you. There will be a link down  
below if you are interested. And if you want to 
buy the class for your team as well, there will  
be another page for that. And you can also book 
a call as well to like discuss any requirements.
