Okay, so earlier today, some interesting 
new features were added to Claude Code,  
so we will be going over them, as well as many 
of the new features from the last two weeks. But  
before getting started, it's worth me mentioning 
that I have a Claude Code masterclass that teaches  
you every single feature in Claude Code, as 
well as many techniques that I've picked up  
myself from over 1000 hours of usage, many of 
which that you will not find anywhere else on  
YouTube. It will be linked down below alongside 
a coupon code, and it does have a seven day money  
back guarantee if you're not satisfied. Okay, 
first of all, they made auto-compacting instant,  
and I noticed this earlier today because I 
compacted this conversation and it basically  
happened immediately. And usually when it came to 
compacting conversations, it would take about two  
minutes, but now it's much faster. And basically 
the way that this works behind the scenes is that  
your .claude folder in your home directory has a 
projects folder. And inside of that, if you go to  
any of your projects, you can then click into 
any of the sessions that you've had or any of  
the chats, go to session memory, and then you can 
see a summary of that session. And basically every  
time you send a message to Claude Code or every 
time it responds to you, it always adds onto the  
session memory, the summary. So you can see it 
kind of looks like this. You have the session  
title, and this is a title that Claude Code came 
up with itself, the current status of the session,  
which includes anything completed, any discussion 
points, and open questions. And then like a bunch  
of other things that you can see described over 
here, some learnings, some key results, and then  
a work log, which is automatically updated every 
time you send a message. So if I quickly send a  
message to chat and say something like, can 
you tell me a short story? And you can see.
Now it says, user requested short story, Claude 
wrote a short story about the conversation itself.  
So basically it's now interesting that every 
time you're using Claude Code, it's automatically  
keeping a memory of the entire session. And I 
believe what's happening is that when you do  
compact and it's instant, what it's actually doing 
is it just loads the summary of that session into  
a brand new session that it was writing as you 
were going along in the previous session. And  
if you are interested in what's stored in the 
session memory, then you can basically just ask  
Claude Code, where is your session memory stored? 
And it will tell you the exact location because it  
knows its own like session ID. And you can see in 
my case, here it is, and I can just click on that  
and then see the current status of the session. 
Anyways, I thought that was a pretty interesting  
decision and I guess you can have fun looking 
at the session memory if you are interested in  
what Claude Code is doing behind the scenes. 
Okay, so now agents and bash commands can run  
asynchronously and send messages to wake up the 
main agent. So for example, I can spawn a brand  
new subagent by saying, can you spawn a general 
purpose subagent to do intensive research online  
and explain to people why they should take my 
Claude Code masterclass with a link? And then  
press enter. And now you can see it spawns up this 
agent with this task given to it. And then I can  
press control B to move it into background. And 
now you can see it's looking for the agent output,  
but I can press exit because it's listening 
for the agent output. I can press exit,  
continue on saying like hi, tell me a story, for 
example. And then the chat can continue as normal,  
like it just told me a story. I can then do slash 
tasks and see that agent is running async in the  
background. Press enter, click on it to see how 
many tokens it's used so far. Then I can also  
see the token count go up. And everything else 
that it's doing here. And then I can continue  
doing my work as normal. And finally, once that 
sub agent is done, it will then wake up the main  
agent again. And then finally, once it is done, 
it will say agent completed. The research agent  
has completed synthesis and Claude Code will use 
a new tool called the agent output tool to then  
look at the response that the agent then gave 
it. And then it will like combine that response  
into the main agent's task at hand. So you can 
see now the comprehensive research for why you  
should take the Claude Code masterclass is now 
ready. And then I can use this for marketing  
material or something like that. So this can be 
pretty useful in situations where you're coding  
on something. You can get a subagent to then like 
search to find information in the background and  
then come back and resume the session once they 
found that information. Likewise, the same thing  
also applies for bash commands. So in certain 
situations, you may be running a npm install  
command or ffmpeg command or something like that, 
which may take a while in the background. You can  
just leave that running in the background and then 
continue on with any work that you want to do. And  
the way of doing it with a bash command should be 
pretty similar to what I just showed you earlier.  
Stats now provides users with interesting Claude 
Code stats such as favorite model, usage graph and  
usage streak. So if I do stats, so these are my 
stats and I think they only started recording this  
recently because I don't see any stats from like 
this time. So yeah, I'm not sure what's up with  
that, but basically it seems my favorite model is 
Sonnet 4.5 and that's probably because I use a lot  
of Sonnet 4.5 based sub agents. I used 10 million 
tokens so far. My longest session was one day and  
eight hours and I've been basically using it every 
single day so I can like copy these stats by doing  
and then if I go to Twitter and then press Command 
+ V, then you can see I can just share the stats  
online pretty easily. If I press Tab to then go 
to Models Tab, I can then see how many tokens I've  
used per day for all the different types of models 
available. And I can do Control + S again to copy  
this and then go to Twitter and then do Control + 
V to paste it. So yeah, this can be a pretty good  
way to compare people within the company maybe 
for fun or something like that. They now added  
named session support, so you can do slash rename 
to name sessions and then resume sessions by a  
particular name that you gave it early on. But 
I think that may be broken. Because it doesn't  
recognize a command slash rename. So maybe they 
will fix it later. But what I have noticed is that  
if you do slash resume, then you can see all your 
previous sessions and you can also rename sessions  
here as well. So if you do R, then you can just 
rename the session and I can call this like R  
type in YouTube, press enter, and now the session 
has been renamed to YouTube. And if I want to,  
I can do Claude dash dash resume and then 
put in YouTube and that will resume that  
previous session. Likewise, the resume screen now 
groups forked sessions together and has keyboard  
shortcuts like preview and rename. So if I go 
to slash resume again, and I can go to previous  
session like how does auto compact work for you? 
Press P, I can see everything within that session  
and I can choose to resume it by pressing enter 
or pressing escape to go back. And for example,  
this session over here has narrow. So if I press 
B, then I can see any previous sessions that  
existed in that main session. Because I compacted 
that session, a brand new session was spawned that  
was forked out of the main main session. And then 
I can resume any of those previous sessions from  
before it actually compacts to the conversation, 
which can be pretty handy. Another handy thing is  
you can press A to then show all your projects, 
because when you do resume, then you can only  
see the sessions that happened in that particular 
folder that you're currently inside. We have now  
also added support for Claude rules. So basically 
with Claude's memory, there are four types of  
memory locations in a hierarchical structure. 
So the enterprise project memory, project rules,  
user memory, and project memory local. So this 
is quite a lot, but the way it's loaded in is  
Enterprise is loaded in first, then the project 
CLAUDE.md file that you may already have. Then you  
can now define project based rules. And this 
basically allows you to modularize your real  
files better, kind of like Cursor rules, if you 
do remember that. So if you scroll down, you can  
basically see this is a structure in your .claude 
folder. You'd have your CLAUDE.md file inside your  
project. And then you can have rules for different 
types of things. If you don't define a path at the  
very top of the rule, then it will be applied all 
the time. But if you do define a path, such as an  
APIs folder, then that rule will only apply to 
files within that folder. So you can see how  
the setup is. It's like pretty similar to Cursor 
rules if you're already familiar with that. Now,  
of course, the advantage is you can now organize 
your CLAUDE.md file better and have it only apply  
to specific folders. So for example, if you have a 
big mono repo like me for this particular project,  
I can extract some stuff that only apply to the 
CloudFlare workers and then some other stuff that  
would only apply to macOS application over stuff 
that would apply to a website and so forth. I will  
be covering this in more detail such as how to 
get it set up, use sim links, user level rules  
and stuff. In my Claude Code masterclass as well, 
pretty soon. For multiple choice questions, Claude  
Code will now use a recommended indicator with 
the recommended option being moved to top of the  
list. So this can be useful in planning mode when 
you're not exactly sure which option you should  
take. Whenever Claude Code now makes a commit, 
it will then say which model actually wrote the  
code here. You can now enable and disable MCP 
servers quickly by doing /mcp enable and then  
the server name. So for example, MCP, I can see 
I have the Supabase MCP installed. I can do MCP.
Disable. Supabase and that will quickly disable 
the Supabase MCP. If for some reason you want to  
launch Claude Code without any slash commands, 
then you can use this. So you can do claude  
--disable slash commands. And then if you 
do something like slash MCP or slash resume,  
you won't see any of the commands available. So 
I guess this gives you a more minimal like just  
chatting with Claude experience. Maybe they now 
also added a dash dash agent CLI flag to override  
the agent settings for the current session. And 
that basically means that if you have some kind of  
sub agent in your session, then you can run Claude 
Code as that particular sub-agent. So for example,  
I have a macOS log analyzer sub-agent that uses 
a Haiku model because it doesn't need a more  
powerful one. I can copy over the name of that 
sub-agent, do claude-agent, put in the name, press  
enter, and then you can see we'll automatically 
run as the macOS log analyzer sub-agent. And I'll  
say, what do you do? And then you can see it says, 
I'm Claude Code, blah, blah, blah, macOS unified  
log analysis. So I think that can be pretty cool. 
You can run Claude Code as any of the sub-agents  
that you have in your project so you can have 
all the same instructions that the sub agents  
do and actually manually execute a particular 
sub agent. I can also run Claude Code as any of  
the default Claude Code sub agents by doing claude 
dash dash agent and plan for example. And that is  
the planning sub agent that is built into Claude 
Code. And then if I say, what do you do? Then it  
will let me know of the planning responsibilities 
and capabilities that it has. So what this means  
is by default, if you leave out the agent flag, 
then Claude Code will run as the main agent that  
is built into Claude Code. But if you specify an 
agent flag, then you can you can use any of the  
default subagents, like manually, like control 
them, or you can use any of the subagents that  
you have actually installed or created in your 
project. And this can be pretty good because  
usually when Claude Code spawns up subagents, like 
you can't stay the subagent in any particular way,  
it just runs and then comes back to you. But in 
this case, you can probably diagnose subagents to  
make sure they operate well by actually running 
the subagent manually and trying to like get a  
feel for it. They also now added the ability to 
delegate tasks to Claude Code from Slack. So in  
Slack, you can go to the app section, search for 
Claude, and then click on it and press press add  
to Slack to add it to your workspace. And then it 
will ask you for like permission and stuff. So you  
can press allow. And now it says Claude Code is 
now installed. So we can go back to Slack. And now  
here we have Claude available. So I can press 
connect account, then connect to my Anthropic  
account, go back to Slack again. And then I can 
choose a model that's used for conversation,  
choose whether it's code only or code plus chat, 
see the organization. And then inside a channel  
I can do @Claude and be like, hey, can you add 
a Chinese translation to a landing page for my  
application, HyperWhisper? And then that, 
and then HyperWhisper will transcribe what  
I just said. And then Claude Code will be like, 
Hey, I'm going to get started with this. But it  
seems I have to add Claude to channel first. So 
I'll add Claude to channel and that's organizing  
gathering information, and then it will generate 
me a response. But it's now asking me the repo  
it should work in because I can't identify that. 
So this can be pretty useful if you want to work  
with Claude Code on a bug fix or something in 
your team, or if you have some kind of channel  
on your team Slack where you're regularly getting 
bug fixes or issues coming in, you can just tag  
Claude Code. And if you want to extend the ability 
then you can go to Claude, press connect to Slack  
connector, and within the connectors over here, 
you can add a custom connector to like the Sentry  
MCP server or something or your own logging 
system. And if you are interested in buying my  
speech text application, HyperWhisper, then there 
will be a link and coupon code for that down below  
as well. I am also working on a Windows version as 
well, so that will be out within the next month or  
so. But if you press download now, then you can 
put in your email and then you'll get notified  
when the Windows version is out. Anyways, just 
before ending the video, I remember reading the  
measuring political bias in Claude like article 
that Anthropic wrote, and this graph was pretty  
interesting because it shows a bunch of different 
models. It is one month old, so some of the models  
are not on here. But Opus 4.1 was the best at 
considering opposing or counter arguments to like  
political problems. And maybe the fact that Claude 
is better at considering opposing perspectives and  
counter arguments that can carry over to making 
better decisions when it comes to coding. And I  
imagine like since Opus 4.1 was the best here, 
it's quite likely that Opus 4.5 is pretty good  
as well. Or score slightly higher on this like 
eval or benchmark thing that they have. Anyways,  
hopefully that video was pretty interesting and 
you learned something useful. If you do like this  
kind of content, then do subscribe to the channel 
because it lets YouTube know that this is a good  
video and you will get recommended more videos 
like this in the future. And if you are interested  
in my Claude Code masterclass, then that will 
be linked down below alongside a coupon code.  
And I will be updating the class in the next two 
days with all the new features that I just talked  
about in the video. There's a seven day money back 
guarantee if you don't like the class. And so far,  
less than 0.5% of people have asked for their 
money back. So that's how I know the class is  
really good because like people just like 
enjoy to the class and they don't ask for a  
refund. And yeah, because I've never accepted 
a sponsor on the channel and never want to to  
keep my videos unbiased, classes like 
this and my software like HyperWhisper  
basically helps keep the channel going. So 
if you're interested then do check it out.
