Okay, so a few hours ago, Anthropic 
released a brand new feature,  
which many people are calling Anthropic's own 
version of OpenClaw, OpenClaw for grownups,  
and now saying they don't even need to use 
OpenClaw or ClaudeBot anymore because they  
can just replicate the same thing inside of 
Claude Code. And this new feature is being able  
to control Claude Code running locally on your 
machine from your phone or another device. Now,  
you could have kind of done this before by using 
tmux, Tailscale, and also Terminus on your phone..
And I've covered that before in 
my Claude Code Masterclass. But  
that was like kind of a hassle to do. 
And this update makes it much simpler  
because now you can just use a Claude 
Code app, kind like a messaging app.
Now let's go for an example of how you can use 
this. Now you want to go to a folder. I'm going  
to go to my RayOS folder, which contains all 
my life stuff that I manage with Claude Code.
And then do claude rc or claude 
remote-control. Press enter. And  
then that will spin up an instance of Claude Code.
So the very first time you run it, you 
may see something like this where you  
have to enable it. And that opens a secure 
connection from your computer to Anthropic  
servers. Now I'm actually gonna run this 
in dangerously skip permissions instead.
So let me stop that, do Claude dangerously 
skip permissions so it can do more things on  
my computer. And what I can do is do /remote 
control to enable it for this session. And  
if I want to enable it for every single 
session that I run in the future as well,  
I can do /config search for remote control.
And it says enable remote control for 
all sessions. I'm going to change this  
to yes or true and then press 
Escape. And now remote control  
will be available for every session of 
Claude Code that I run in the future.
So anyways, let's make sure that we have 
the Claude app installed, open it up,  
log into our account, then go to the code tab 
on the left-hand side and then find our session.  
Can you go to my Google Drive folder and then 
figure out where the raw MP4 file is and then  
edit the video with the, uh, video editor 
skill. So as soon as I send that message,  
you can see it now appears on my computer.
So it's first going to go to my Google 
Drive, but I should have been a bit  
more specific because I have Google Drive 
set up locally. And recently I actually  
made a brand new skill for Claude Code to 
edit my videos for me. So this video that  
you're watching right now has been edited by 
Claude Code, but it's only like 95% perfect.
So I still have to like clean 
up some loose ends myself. Um,  
but yeah, now you can see it's now 
downloading the video that I want  
edited. And whilst that's happening, 
I'm going to start a brand new session.
So I could also be coding 
on projects, for example,  
like I have this project right over here 
and then I can remote control this session.  
Since I already had it enabled before, 
it's already enabled. So I can go back.
Can you make the macOS release bump up the 
minor version? And yeah, that command sends  
off to my computer and it will work normally. 
Now the nice thing is that every time there is  
a permission that your computer requires because 
you're not in dangerously skip permissions,  
for example, you can allow it. And that 
is one of the benefits over using tmux  
and Terminus for this because it was like 
quite fiddly to allow it from your phone.
Now, one of the benefits about this is that you 
have access to all your Claude Code config from  
your phone. So whatever skills you have set up, 
MCP servers and so forth. So if I run claude rc,  
then I can trigger plan mode and also the Exa 
MCP server that I have enabled from my phone.
So let me go to the session over here. Switch 
over to plan mode. And if I press enter,  
you can see it's now using the Exa MCP 
server that I have set up on my computer.
Now this means that you can have MCP server set 
up for background research tasks, for example,  
and then you can just be triggering the use of 
them from your phone. And now we can see that  
planning mode is asking us some questions 
that we can enter in from our phone. So I  
can just say like, hello, press submit, and 
I can answer a lot of questions that way.
So that can be pretty helpful for just 
making plans on the go because you can go  
out for lunch and then continue working on 
your application. And now going back here,  
we can see Claude Code is still editing 
that video for us. So let's talk about  
the most important thing here, which is security.
You don't want to be on bypass permissions 
or dangerously skip permissions all the  
time because that can get quite dangerous, 
especially if it's connected to internet.  
Now your version of Claude Code, which has 
remote control enabled, is connected securely  
via Anthropic's own servers to your phone 
or to another machine. So if I wanted to,  
I could go to the Claude AI website from 
another machine And then I can see that  
I have this remote session right now, which is 
the same session that is happening on my phone.
And the server remote session is the one that 
is editing the video for us. But if I was kind  
of worried about it accidentally being prompt 
injected by searching online or deleting a file,  
I could either do one of two things, 
either use the Claude Code sandbox  
or have Claude Code running on a remote 
server somewhere. So I'll show you how  
you can install Claude Code on a remote 
server so you can have it run dangerously  
skip permissions over there and do like 
web research for you and stuff like that.
Without worrying about it accidentally 
deleting your files or doing unintended  
things on your computer. So I'm 
gonna log into my Hetzner account  
and then just quickly set up a server for 
myself here. So you can do create server,  
choose the cheapest one, which is $3.49 a month. 
Choose— choose Germany over here, create my SSH  
key and add to that here. And then call the 
server Claude Code and press create and buy.
And now what I can do is SSH into that server 
copy over the install command for Claude code,  
go back to the server, press enter. And 
then after it's installed, I can do Claude,  
press enter. But I actually have to 
copy over this command to fix the bash,  
do Claude, sign in with my Anthropic subscription.
And then finally I can run tmux on the 
server, run Claude inside of tmux. Yes,  
I accept. Do /remote-control, enable 
remote control for the session..
And then I can detach from this terminal 
session safely and have it running on the  
cloud. So if I press Ctrl+B and then 
type in colon detach, press Enter,  
then I can go back to my phone's version of Claude 
Code. And then I can see I have this interactive  
session and then I can chat with it and say stuff 
like searching online, tell me about Claude Code.
So I could install my MCP servers onto this 
server and then have it continuously work  
for me in the background on different tasks 
and not have to worry about my computer being  
on all the time. So I can do research with 
different MCP servers, make reports for me,  
and even if it did get prompt injected, 
any damage that it does would be limited  
to the server that it's currently on. Now, 
another way of doing this is you can use  
sandboxing in Claude Code and have your remote 
control sessions run through that sandbox.
So I cover much more about sandboxing in my 
master Claude Code class that will be linked  
down below if you're interested. 
But to give you a brief overview,  
if you make a folder like this and inside 
of your settings.local JSON file, you type  
in something like this, sandbox enabled 
true, permissions default mode don't ask.
I can give it a list of websites I 
can just go to and do research on.  
And then I can deny any tools such as 
editing or writing tools, for example,  
and bash tools. And if I start a remote 
session of Claude Code here by doing claude rc,  
I can go to a session which is in the sandbox 
research environment here and then say,  
go on archive and find me the latest AI papers 
and summarize 5 that look interesting to you.
You can see it can go and archive and 
not ask me for permissions because that  
is allowed over here. And then 
after pulling in the papers,  
it gave me some interesting summaries of them. 
So if I told it to fetch masterclaudecode.com,  
then you can see that it won't work because that 
URL has been blocked. But one of the problems can  
be that it may still decide to go on the website 
via a curl command, which can be dangerous. But  
in this case, it does not have access to 
bash tools, so it won't be able to do that.
Now, one of the ways to make this stricter and 
more secure is to use a proxy. So for example,  
I would want it to be able to do curl requests,  
but I want to deny the WebFetch tool and the 
WebSearch tool because those would bypass the  
proxy. And then I should set up a network 
port over here. So that is HTTP proxy port.  
And then you want to make a proxy that looks 
kind of like this so you can get Claude Code  
to write you one. And you want to make sure 
that api.anthropic.com is allowed because  
that allows for the remote connection. Because 
if you don't, you may run into some problems.
Now if I enable the proxy by doing node 
proxy.js, then do claude rc dangerously  
skip permissions. And then I can test out the 
proxy to make sure that it works by trying to  
go to my personal domain. So that should fail 
because, like, it's not allowed by the proxy.
So you can see on the computer, it says 
HTTP GET blocked. But if I tell it to,  
like, do masterclaudecode.com instead,  
then that should work just fine 
because that is allowed by the proxy.
So you can see, passed successfully via the 
proxy, and then it loaded in the page. So  
this is another way that you can make sure 
that you are using remote control securely,  
with dangerously skip permissions. So you could 
have like research agents that are only allowed  
to go on a set of websites, for example. You 
can also block a lot of permissions to prevent  
anything bad happening on your computer. 
And it's like really easy to customize.
Now, one of the big differences 
from OpenClaw is that it's more  
passive and less proactive. So you can 
get OpenClaw to like search online at a  
scheduled interval for you. And then send 
you messages. Here it's more like passive,  
so you give it and tell it to do 
something, it does it for a while.
But given how popular it's gotten, I imagine that 
Claude Code or the Anthropic team will slowly be  
adding them over time because it seems they kind 
of have an interest in the space. One feature that  
I would really like to see is basically the 
ability to connect hooks to notifications on  
your phone. So currently you can have Claude 
Code send you notifications on your computer  
using like Apple Scripts or something, but if 
Anthropic allowed for those notifications to be  
sent to your phone if you're remote controlling, 
I think that would make it even more powerful.
But yeah, I'm sure they will be adding a lot more 
to it over time to improve it. Now it may be the  
case that you no longer need to use OpenClaw 
because this satisfies a lot of use cases for  
you. And I know for me personally, because I 
usually manage everything in my RayOS folder,  
the fact that I can now use this remotely 
from my phone means that I can just have  
it running all the time and then just be giving 
prompts to my RayOS folder to like draft emails,  
download files, do some video editing, 
and a bunch of other things as well,  
whilst using my Claude Code 
subscription to save on money.
Now Claude Code has finished editing that 
video, so I'm going to get it to edit this  
video and then finally upload it. Anyways, 
I'm sure Anthropic I think will be making  
much more improvements here over time because 
they seem to be shipping a new update like  
almost every single day. And if you do want 
to get my own thoughts about it and ways in  
which I'm using it, then you can sign up to my 
newsletter, which will be linked down below.
You do get access to a bunch 
of bonus free videos as well  
that you won't find here on the YouTube channel.
