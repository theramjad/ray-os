Okay, so we will be going over every
single feature of Cloud Code that was
added in the last week. But before
getting started, it's worth me
mentioning that I have a Cloud Code
masterass where I go through every
single feature of Cloud Code as well as
a bunch of bonus content and techniques,
some of which you won't find anywhere
else here on YouTube. And since I've
never accepted a sponsor on the channel
and never plan to, my classes and also
applications like Hyperisper basically
keep the channel going. Anyways, getting
started. Claude Code can now control
Claude in Chrome. So if you don't know
already, this is a browser extension for
Google Chrome and Chromium based
browsers. So when you sign into your
account and click on the button, then
you can see you have claude on the right
hand side here and you can do like any
basic tasks like getting it to summarize
a page and so forth. But the interesting
thing here is that now claude code can
connect and control your browser via
this extension. So firstly you want to
make sure you're on the latest version
of cloud code by doing cloud update and
then after that you can run cloud code
and then you want to run/chrome and then
you can see the extension is installed
and the status is enabled. So you may
need to run connect extension or
something and then after that you can go
to manage permissions and then basically
see all the permissions that claude in
chrome has access to and then using my
application hyposisper there will be a
link down below to this. I can basically
say something like can you go to chat
JPT and then ask Chad GPT a question and
then give me the answer back and then
press enter and then you can see that it
spawns up a brand new tab for me like a
brand new window where it's going to
start executing on things and you can
see cloud code can see the available
tabs that has access to and in Chrome at
least it kind of has this tab group that
it can like control. Can you ask Chipt
why they should take Ray Amjad's
mastercloud code class and then press
enter and then we should [clears throat]
see actually executing on things and now
you can see it's actually executing
because it goes to chajbt.com
it then takes a screenshot I think to
basically understand how things are
looking so if we put this on the left
hand side
and you can see then enters information
into chat GBT on the right hand side
presses enter and then it snoozes for
about 3 seconds and it's like still
waiting and one of of the things that it
actually has access to is any console
logs inside the browser. So when cloud
code is executing and actually doing
things within your browser like pressing
buttons, clicking around, entering text,
then it can debug itself if it runs into
a console like browser error. And of
course, you can get it to many other
things as well. Previously, you could
have used like cloud in Chrome to like
go on LinkedIn or another website and
scrape data. Um, but here it's like much
nicer because it's two linked together.
So then you can use cloud code to
connect an MCP server, use any sub
agents, connect to skills and basically
do everything else cloud code can do
with the browser basically attached onto
it. So this can be useful for people who
are using like the puppet MCP server or
something like that. You can probably
replace that with this cloud in Chrome
uh connected to cloud code and now Chad
JPT basically gave a bunch of the
reasons why you should take the class
and then claude code actually scrolls
down through the web page to gather all
the information and then it will provide
it back to me. So this should open up a
bunch more use cases because whilst we
did have similar things before we now
have a more tightly coupled solution
with cloud code that should perform
better as well. And then we have the
answer that cloud code gave from charg.
So I just tried to get it to run cloud
in chrome with cloud code inside a sub
aent because it does fill up the context
window when it's doing a bunch of things
and I only want the final result but
currently it doesn't seem to be able to
do that for some reason. So I think if
that was added then this feature would
basically be perfected. You can also say
are there any console errors for example
and then claude in Chrome would read the
console log messages as well. Anyways,
we now have reduced terminal flickering
and there's a good post on Twitter by
one of the developers about why this was
an issue for such a long time and yeah,
you can read through that yourself. It's
pretty interesting. If you do / mobile
now, then you can see that it shows a
cure code to go to the iOS store or
Android store to download the mobile
app. Unfortunately, they changed the
thinking toggle from tab to alt t
instead, which basically means that
previously if you press tab, then that
would turn on thinking. Now, if you
press option t on your keyboard if
you're on Mac OS, or alt t if you're on
Windows, then that should show thinking
mode. But you can see it shows a dagger
for me right now. And that's like
something built into Mac OS. So, what
you want to do is if you're using warp,
then you want to go to settings in the
top right, search for meta. And where it
says left option key is meta, you want
to turn that on. And now, if you press
option T, it should then turn off and on
thinking. So, if you're seeing a dagger
on Mac OS after pressing option T, then
you want to go to your settings on your
terminal and find a setting that's kind
of like this. Left option key is meta.
In some cases, cloud code may also show
you prompt suggestions when it thinks
you're about to do something. So you can
see in this case the person commits the
changes locally on their computer and
then it suggests push the changes. So
you can press tab and then that will
like autofill the prompt and then you
can press enter. So I personally found
this behavior to be pretty annoying when
it came to coding. So what I do is I
just go to the /config and then when it
says prompt suggestions I just turn that
off instead. Th Code now also has
improved syntax highlighting to show
which changes actually made to your
codebase. So this is what it currently
looks like. And if I go to a previous
example, this is what it kind of looks
like before. So you can see putting them
side by side, the new one does look
better because of the color scheme and
the line number being highlighted and a
few other things. When it comes to
plugins, there's now a firstparty
marketplace. If you do/ plugins, then
you can see all the official cloud code
plugins that they have available. So
like chrome dev tubes, aauna, code
review, opusi migration, contact 7. So
this is what the official marketplace
looks like on GitHub. And then for these
marketplaces, you can also disable
automatic updating uh to preserve a
older version of the marketplace on your
computer. They now also add a brand new
currency usage field to the status line
input, which means that you can now have
more accurate status lines. So if you do
/ status line and then after that you
say something like
can you basically make a pretty simple
status line that has like a battery and
it shows an amount of context that I've
used in the current context window so
far. And you can see this is the kind of
status line that it now came up with,
which should be pretty accurate because
it now has access to that current usage
information. They did remove the hashtag
shortcut for adding things to cloud.md
file. So maybe they will use that for
something else in the future. Thinking
mode will now be on by default when
you're using Opus 4.5. Now when you're
in the middle of writing a prompt, you
can switch out the model to a different
one before pressing enter by pressing
option P on Mac OS or alt P on Windows.
And this is pretty handy because
otherwise you would have pressed enter
then stop the agent and then switch the
model and then press enter again. And
those are basically all the changes that
I thought were worth talking about. And
also I was watching this video or
podcast episode of the creative cloud
code talking about cloud code itself.
And like I really begin to understand
why it's such a good coding agent
because they're not focused on their
competitors like whilst many competitors
like Codex CLI factory CLI and so forth
are looking at the new features that
cloud code has introduced and adding it
to their own coding agents. Cloud code
is still kind of leading the way because
he just doesn't look at what the
competitors are doing. He says that he
just builds things that are useful to
improp employees and also their users
instead of doing anything like looking
at competitors. So I guess that's
probably one reason why cloud code is
always one step ahead of everyone else.
Anyways, if you are interested in
learning more about how you can be using
Cloud Code effectively and a bunch of
advanced techniques to get the most out
of it, then I do cover that in my Cloud
Code Masterass that will be linked down
below. And if you are interested in
hearing from me on a more regular basis
in your email inbox and you're having
the algorithm only tell you when videos
are published, then I do have an email
newsletter that I just started and I
will be sharing a bunch of techniques
I'm discovering, any thoughts that I
have on new models, research papers I
have been reading, and a bunch of other
things as well. It is brand new and
there will be a link down below if
you're interested and if you do reply to
any of the emails from the email
newsletter then I will try to reply to
you as well. And finally, if you
interested application that I was using
throughout the video for voice of text,
then that will also be linked down
below. It's my own application and since
I don't accept sponsors, applications
like these and classes basically help
keep the channel
