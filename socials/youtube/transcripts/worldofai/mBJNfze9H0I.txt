Enthropic has officially filled one of
the biggest gaps in AI powered front-end
development with the new bridge between
Claude Code and Figma. You can now push
what you're building in Claude Code
directly into Figma. Thanks to the
latest updates to the Figma MCP server,
you can now build fully working
prototypes in code, then instantly send
it to Figma canvas to explore multiple
versions visually. Figma now lets you
capture live UI's built-in cloud code
and convert them into fully editable
Figma frames. This means that you can
now take a working interface from
production staging or a local host. This
lets you capture individual screens,
states, or entire user flows, paste them
directly into any Figma file, and you
can even edit, duplicate, annotate, and
collaborate with your team. Code is
great for converging, building, and
testing one state at a time. But now,
Figma is powerful for diverging, where
you can compare versions side by side
through the canvas, exploring multiple
alternatives, and refining directions
visually. So, instead of sharing
screenshots or asking teammates to run a
local build, you can bring the actual UI
into a shared design space. And it works
both ways. With the Figma MCP server,
you can move back from Figma into cloud
code, generating design informed code
from your edited frames. So now you have
a full loop cloud code to Figma, Figma
back to the code. Front-end development
definitely just got a lot more fluid
instead of linear. Since Figma shipped
the ability to bring UI work done within
Cloud Code straight into Figma as
editable design frames, you can use this
feature to explore new ideas within
Figma, where you can view multi-page
flows on the canvas or reimagine user
experiences. And what's great is that
you can use Figma's MCP to jump right
back into Cloud Code with your updated
designs. So, this loop is quite
remarkable. If you want to build faster
with AI, I send my exact tools,
workflows, and prompts in my free
newsletter with the link in the
description below, which you can
subscribe completely for free. So, to
get started, there's a couple of
prerequisites that you're going to need
beforehand. Make sure you have Cloud
Code obviously set up, as well as your
Figma account ready on standby. Next is
to head over to Claude Codes MCP docs,
which I'll leave in the description
below, and then copy the Figma MCP
command so that you can enable it
directly within your Cloud Code
instance. And this will connect Cloud
Code to Figma's remote MCP server. Next,
what you want to do is head over to this
blog on Twitter to install the Figma
plugin. And it's super simple. You can
use the /plugin command within Code. And
you can simply just click enter. And
this will install this plugin directly
into your instance. Next, you'll need to
type in /plugin. And this is where you
need to now authenticate Figma. And you
will see that it has been enabled, but
you're going to need to actually enter
in the O. And that is why the Figma
desktop is failing. So, make sure you go
ahead and enter in your O with your
account. Just like that, you can now
start accessing this bridge with Figma
to cloud code and cloud code to Figma.
Essentially what I'm doing right now is
creating a dashboard with cloud code. I
am having it code out all the components
of a modern dashboard UI and it is going
to work on creating this fully
functional interactive dashboard. Once
it has been completed, I'm going to be
showcasing what you can actually do
directly within cloud code to bridge it
to Figma like capturing screens and
flows. I can simply just run a command
which I'll showcase which will capture
the UI and even the full flow and send
it over to Figma as an editable frame.
Then after you have essentially
generated that dashboard, what you can
do is implement that design so that it
is going to be then able to be
transferred over to your Figma canvas.
Now just an FI since I'm not using the
desktop version and using the cloud,
what I had to do was share the actual
design link. And you can do that by
clicking on share, copying the dev mode
link, and then it is going to proceed to
use the Figma plugin to then edit based
off of what our request was, which was
implementing the design. So now what we
can do is back into cloud code, we can
tell it to proceed forward with this.
Now you can see that it has opened up
this dashboard. Now, it's not a great
dashboard or anything cuz I didn't
prompt anything properly, but you can
see that the dashboard has been pushed
to the Figma file and you can actually
view it within your Figma canvas. If I
have to copy this and go over to that
canvas, I'm going to be able to now view
that design that it had actually created
from cloud code directly within Figma.
And this is the frame that it has now
added in. And I have manageable layers
that I can actually tweak. You can see
the left panel of the sidebar. You also
have the login which is kind of uh in
the middle. So it needs to be refined a
little bit more for the navigation. But
that is essentially what you can now do.
This is just a simple way for you to now
connect between the two different tools.
Now to showcase this, I actually use a
couple of libraries within Figma to
generate a coffee app. And this was
directly having claude code actually
code out the components of this that you
can see are actually working. This is
where Figma had given me all the
libraries and then claude code had coded
out all the functions which is just
incredible guys. This is the value of
this combination and you're going to be
able to get a lot of great designs fully
generated with the two. What you can
also do is you can actually connect the
code components to Figma. So you can
connect the Figma design components to
code components using the code connect
plug-in. So this is a way for you to
easily bridge the gap from layers code
directly between these two tools. You
can even create design system rules
where you can generate the custom design
rules for your users codebase and that
is going to make things a lot easier.
The only restriction is that Figma
obviously has the pro tier, which is
where you're going to get the most out
of this bridge cuz with the free tier,
you're not going to be able to do a lot,
especially coding directly within the
canvas and then having it so that you
have more API requests with the MCP.
Cloud code to Figma Bridge isn't just
meant for continuous second by second
switching. It's more of like a modebased
workflow where you use the code mode
with cloud code to iterate quickly,
experiment with your data as well as
testing your interactions with your
front end and then you can use the
design mode with Figma to explore
layouts, tweaking the visuals, annotate,
elaborate, and use the AI to enhance
your generations further. This is
essentially where the value comes from
switching modes intentionally where you
spend minutes or hours in one jump
before you go to the next. And for your
workflows, it is perfect for you to
generate a UI in cloud code like I did,
push it into Figma for exploration or
feedback. Then you can roundtrip the
updates back to the code when you're
actually ready. It's a mode shift, not
any sort of micromanaging that will need
syncing. And that's why it feels natural
for longer design code sprints.
It's going to save a lot of you guys
many hours cuz this is essentially where
you can go from the visual designs as
well from Figma directly into cloud code
to generate the production ready code
for your elements that you had actually
visualized within Figma. This is going
to be a lot easier for you to bridge
this connection through the MCP and the
plug-in where there's no more manual
slicing or guessing styles. You're
essentially just visualizing the canvas
or you're going from the canvas to code
and it is definitely going to polish
this workflow a lot better, saving you a
lot of time. Now, I'm not sponsored by
pencil or anything, but I've already
even made a video on this. And
essentially, this is a better way for
you to visualize your canvas all in a
single place. It is something that is
completely free right now, which is why
I want to showcase this. And I would
recommend to make the most out of this
cuz it works quite well with uh cloud
code. And essentially you can connect
Figma to it so that you can now even
visual visualize live generations of
your canvas while you're coding. So that
is a remarkable tool on its own. And
this way it is easier to just work in
one environment. Like for example with
pencil you have the ability to prepare a
Figma file. You can then essentially
have it so that it uses pencil's
infinite canvas to run the parallel
design agents that's powered by cloud
code that can turn designs into code
which you see over here and it is going
to be able to make one of the best
designs that I have personally seen in
AI generate. It runs locally. It also
works with VS Code as well as cursor and
it's 100% free. If you like this video

more. And that's how easy it is to go
from a design to code or code to a
design with this combination of cloud
code with Figma. I believe that this is
definitely a gamecher for front-end
developers as well as anyone who is
trying to use these tools together. If
