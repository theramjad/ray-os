After spending over 800 hours in Claude
Code, I've discovered ways to actually
make this thing work for me, not against
me. Especially at times when I need to
move fast as a solo developer. Whether
you're churning through tickets at a
corporate tech job or attempting to vibe
code your next 10K a month app. If
Claude has ever felt dumb to you at
times, then it's likely you're just
missing critical parts of the setup. In
this video, I'll walk you through my
private workflows, essential resources,
and teach you the six core features that
most developers are unaware of in Claude
Code. So, by the end, you'll be shipping
faster with Claude instead of wasting
time fighting it. Before we dive into
the advanced workflows and hidden
tricks, let's make sure we quickly cover
the foundations. These free features
have saved me hours of repeating myself
to Claude every single session. When I
first started using Claude Code, I found
myself repeating same instructions over
and over again. The easy solution is to
make use of Claude's memory feature.
Press the hash key to quickly add some
instruction snippets to Claude's memory.
You can decide whether you want to apply
these instructions locally to the
project or globally across all Claude
sessions. And you will see these
instructions get saved to the claude.md
file. So if you ever change your mind,
you can easily edit or remove them. I
also found myself typing the same
prompts to perform small repetitive
tasks like creating a new API endpoint
that correctly includes my custom
middleware with error handling and type
interfaces or running the TypeScript
llinter command and fixing all errors
around the codebase. This led me to
build my own library of custom commands
that I can easily call with a few
keystrokes. To create your first
command, just add a new commands
directory within your clawed folder and
then write out your command in a
markdown file. And as your command
library grows, you can sort them into
subdirectories to keep them organized
and easier to find. You can also make
commands accept arguments. This is what
allows commands to be more flexible and
reusable in different scenarios. So just
be conscious of what you are prompting
to claude over and over again. Then
slowly build up your own command library
as you go. I've also used this GitHub
repo which has a bunch of useful
commands that I use every day for
building. In the early days of building
with clawude code, one of my biggest
frustrations was making sure it
references the latest documentation when
building new features or debugging
errors, especially with frameworks and
libraries that are constantly being
updated. But as you know, AI assistants
are only as good as their training data
and forcing it to use web search to
fetch the latest data wasn't reliable
either. This is where MCP servers come
in. specifically one that I use every
day called Context 7 is essentially a
service that allows Claude to reference
the most up-to-date documentation for
the most popular coding libraries. And
this alone has saved me hours constantly
having to Google search and copy and
paste the latest docs into my prompts.
Now I can just rely on context 7 as a
centralized source for when I need the
AI to reference any kind of
documentation. And to use it, you just
have to add two words into your prompt.
Use context 7 and Claude will
automatically call the server to fetch
the latest docs whenever it needs to.
And you might be asking what exactly are
MCP servers? To explain it simply, just
think of it as a way to connect AI
agents to external tools and services.
And this just gives the AI more
capabilities for its tasks like
connecting to a database, calling a
custom API, or executing code on some
remote server. If you would like to know
where I browse for MCP servers, here are
some great repos that I recommend
checking out. Some other MCP servers
that I use regularly are Superbase to
allow Claude to query data directly from
my app's database, apply migrations or
create new tables for any new features I
am building, the Chrome Dev Tools and
Playright MCP, which gives Claude the
ability to autonomously debug and test
issues on the front end by letting it
control the browser and inspect the DOM
and console logs. I also use the Strap
MCP for when I build something that
touches the payment side of my app and
also the VEL MCP for when I need to look
up the latest documentation or make
changes to my project settings. As a
solo developer, my process for building
new features used to look something like
this. Create the front-end UI
components, write the API endpoints, and
run some database migrations. This
approach wasn't bad, but it just meant I
had to do things in a very sequential
order, which wasn't very efficient. But
ever since I discovered how to properly
use claude sub aents to do work in
parallel, I've been able to build and
ship features in a fraction of the time.
Firstly, what are sub aents? They are
isolated clawed instances that can work
in parallel with each other and feed
crucial information back to the main
orchestrator agent once it has finished
the task. In simple terms, using sub
agents will greatly help reduce any
pollution to the main context window
because each sub agent will get its own
context window, system prompt, [music]
and tool use permissions. So, they are
great for offloading smaller and more
specific tasks. But what I see people
doing with sub agents is they assign
them to act as specific roles like a
front-end developer, a UIUX designer or
a product manager. And I can tell you I
spent a good couple of hours trying to
work with agents this way. And the
results were pretty bad compared to just
using claude code with no agent specific
instructions. Personally, I don't think
sub agents are at a point yet where you
can assign them specific roles and rely
on them to brainstorm and work
autonomously like a real human would.
But that's okay. They still saved me a
lot of time and effort on tasks is
actually good at. What has worked really
well for me is to define sub agents for
tasks, not roles. Like cleaning up and
optimizing the code it has just written,
generating documentation or gathering
research data from the web. For example,
one of the sub aents I use regularly is
this one that reviews the UIUX of my
app. It connects to the Playright MCP
server and inspects the UI components of
my web app in the browser and it gives
feedback based on the design and
usability of the UI components. I think
this is the best way to make use of sub
aents because it handles work that would
have previously taken up precious
context tokens from the main agent and
it just helps to maintain a higher
quality of the overall output. To create
a sub agent, use the / agents command.
Select create a new agent. Choose
project or personal. Select generate
with Claude. Then describe the sub aents
task in natural language. Customize the
tool use permissions and then save. And
to invoke a sub aent, just use natural
language or the ad symbol to directly
call the sub aent within your prompt.
Now that I've told you all about slash
commands, sub aents, and MCP servers,
you might be put off by the thought of
having to set up all these tools
manually for your own projects. Well,
luckily, Anthropic recently released a
new feature called plugins, which allows
users to bundle up their setups into a
single package. So, you can literally
clone a Claude Power user's entire
workflow with a single command. And if
you're curious about my personal setup,
I've published my own plug-in
marketplace, which you can add by
running this command. From there, just
pick and choose which plugins you would
like to install. Feel free to add only
what you need. I want to talk about the
mindset and expectations I've adopted
when working with AI to build apps.
Because after spending hundreds of hours
of trial and error using AI to help with
coding tasks, I found these are the
things that have given me the biggest
productivity boost. Garbage in equals
garbage out. If you can't write a prompt
that clearly instructs the AI on what to
do, then you don't actually know what
you want, and the AI definitely won't
either. I found learning some basic
prompt engineering has forced me to
break down my problems into smaller
pieces, which also clarifies my own
thoughts in the process. Or if the idea
is still vague in my mind, I will use
Claude's plan mode to have a quick Q&A
session and make it ask me clarifying
questions so we can be on the same page
before I let it write any code. AI
generates code, but humans own it.
Before pushing to production, just start
a new session with the AI, asking it to
review the code on the files it's
recently touched. Don't let the AI make
you lazy about the fundamentals like
security, performance, or error
handling, because given enough time, if
you keep ignoring these things, it will
eventually lead to vulnerabilities and
bugs if you don't constantly review it.
Speed means nothing if your app is buggy
or insecure. So, these have been my top
tips for getting the most out of Claude
Code when building apps as a solo
developer. Let me know what you think
and I'll see you in the next one.
Bye-bye.
