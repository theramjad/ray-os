Literally years and years and years of
marketing work can be done in a single
week by one person thanks to AI. Now we
also get to do 10 times more for our
clients 10 times [music] faster. This is
the kind of stuff that WordPress
agencies have been charging their
clients tens of thousands of dollars
for. I'm going to share my screen. You
got to see this.
>> Cory Haynes is the founder of Conversion
Factory, the SAS marketing and design
agency.
The next thing
>> presented by Zapier, the AI automation
company. Building with AI is so freaking
fun. But getting users tough, right?
Well, today's guest created skills that
makes it well, really easy. He's going
to walk us through how to do it right
now. Here's my challenge to you. Let's
take a single business and show how your
marketing tools could help them. So,
this is Sahil Bloom. He wrote this post
saying, "There's an incredible
opportunity right now for someone to
build a $100,000 a month side hustle and
AI concierge. Basically, just go to
people's homes and set them up with all
the AI tools they need. Here's a guy who
just a few days ago decided he was going
to build that business. It's called
Setup Claw. Here's what the site looks
like. How would you improve his
business? Turn it from like a really
cool side project to something that
actually produces revenue."
>> Yeah. Yeah, I mean first of all we need
to make it more than just a single page
website. We need the actual marketing
for it. I'm a huge proponent of the SEO.
So I can show a lot of SEO use cases and
I think that uh right now people are
going to be googling and also asking the
the chatbts and AI chats about how to
set these kinds of things up. And so we
can create a lot of pages and just basic
foundational marketing pieces probably
just in under an hour that can showcase
how he can start to expand beyond just
having a single page website um and be
more discoverable around the web which
is a more mature marketing function.
>> Okay, let's see what AI can do for
marketing. You want to share your
screen?
>> You need to open your terminal and then
you need to install a project called
Node.js. I'm going to skip through that
now just for the sake of time. Once you
have Node.js installed, then you need to
install cloud code. If you can figure
that out, I mean, you're still like
ahead of 90% of people as I think you
did yesterday, Andrew. Um, but once you
have that done, then we can actually
start up Claude. And so in my terminal,
I'm just going to say Claude, I have
this autocomplete, so I'm going to do
this kind of mode called dangerously
skip permissions. And this is like a
yolo mode where we get to fly through
things without it stopping us and kind
of asking for permission. Uh because we
just want to fly through this demo,
right? So um one of the first things
we're going to do is I'm going to
basically replicate what setup claw has
right now. I'm not going to worry about
the content. I'm not even going to tell
it what's what it's going to do. I'm
just in fact going to speak to it and
I'm going to use my little uh AI
dictation thing. I'm going to say let's
build a new website in Nex.js called
setupclaw. Please install it using the
defaults.
And that's going to go here in my
terminal. And now I am going to Oh, I
got the little say. That's funny.
I'm going to let it rip. I'm going to
watch it uh go. It's going to kind of go
through some basic coding things where
it's now installing a bunch of uh fancy
code things. This is Nex.js. This is
Verscel's framework for TypeScriptbased
websites. Um, you don't really even need
to know any of that stuff. All you need
to know that's important is that AI
really likes this framework and this
language and it makes it really easy to
make something that looks good is
usually, you know, relatively bug free
and they also have a really good
ecosystem for other AI features in the
future. But um
now we have something uh and you know
what I even skipped a step here because
I got too eager. But I want to tell it
um put it under documents and then under
code
because that's the folder that I
actually want to work out of.
>> Okay.
>> And so now it's going to move it from
just being under my root file on my
computer, which I really should not have
done. I should have slowed down and
said, "Okay, let's move it actually to
uh a subfolder so that it's in the right
place." Okay, now it's in the right
place. Um, one of the big differences
you'll see right away is that cloud code
isn't just going to tell you what you
should do or how to do it like a chatbt,
it's going to actually just do the thing
for you,
>> which is kind of the setup here for why
this is so important for marketing
because instead of being like um, write
me copy for my website, you can say
build me a website and you don't just
say make me a plan to build, you know, a
100 pages for programmatic SEO. You can
say build a,000 pages and just go and
run and let it rip. Um, so we have our
project here. Uh, now the next step that
I want to do is I want to get a simple
version of this website up. So I'm going
to tell it build a simple
landing page that describes
what it does and then spin up a local
host dev server for me to see.
So this is what it just spun up.
Obviously it's very unbranded. This is
boilerplate Nex.js kind of stuff. Um and
it took its best guess at what we were
actually building. So it says configure
cloud code in minutes, not hours. The
good news is we have a page to work off
of. And you can see that even just in a
couple of minutes we have something to
work off of where I would have had to
use a template or handcode this myself
which would take you know a couple of
hours to fiddle around with.
>> Okay.
Um, now I think pro probably what we
want to do is start showing some of the
marketing use cases. So, I created a
bunch of these skills for the agents to
be able to upgrade their knowledge about
marketing and how to do specific uh
things like copywriting, building
landing pages, competitor comparison
pages, email sequences, doing conversion
rate optimization on forms or onboarding
or even managing paid ads. This is like
the amalgamation of everything I've ever
learned about marketing in one place.
I'm going to give it the command. I can
also run the command myself, but again,
I'm using an agent. I might as well just
give it, you know, plain language and
let it do the rest. Now, it's going to
do the terminal command to install the
skills. It's going to install them
locally. We can give it a reference
point. So, I can tell it
now, please look at setupclaw.com
because that's his current site. And
this is probably going to have the best
information about what he does and how
it works
>> better than I could describe it because
he just told me about this like 10
minutes ago.
And so uh this will make our lives a
little bit easier to say look at
setupclaw and study what it does and
then use the copywriting skill to write
a new version of the landing page.
I'm going to let it go.
All right, it says that it's done. Um,
still running. I'm going have to refresh
here. You can see that it has 14
sections that it created. So, we'll go
and double check that key copy principle
is added. This is our new version.
We deploy open class so you don't have
to. Here's a little thing here.
>> We have uh some social proof.
This is like a [clears throat] problem
statement. Hey, here's why it's hard to
install OpenClaw yourself. Um, which it
is very, very difficult to do yourself
if you've never done it before. We
handle everything. Um, here's a how it
works. So, we have five steps to make it
feel kind of easy. More social proof,
integrations, pricing,
FAQ, and then a final call to action.
So, this is just a first pass, right?
And you can see how I'm telling it you
need to make sure that you have all
these types of sections. The way that
you write should be this way and not
that way. I doubt that you would find
any chatbt isms in here.
>> You were telling me that one of the cool
things about this is now if I want more
SEO pages, I can just ask for them,
right? What would I do? How would I do
that?
>> When you hear programmatic SEO, what
does that mean to you?
>> It kind of reminds me of the old Zapier,
who by the way is a sponsor. Zapier got
really big in the early days because
they would see that they could connect
all these different apps together and
they had software create landing pages
for each one of them. So if somebody
said, "I want to know how to connect
what was big at the time. Let's say
Gmail and Evernote," they would have a
page that says, "I can help you connect
Gmail and Evernote. Here's how you could
do it. If you want to do it on your own,
here's how you could do it with us."
That's programmatic SEO. How is that
what you mean here?
>> You nailed it right on the head. So you
might say, "You know what? I'm not
really sure if that strategy is right
for me. So, you can say, um, let's use
the programmatic SEO skill, but don't
make any pages yet. First, let's plan
and strategize to see which playbooks
might be right for my project.
Now, we're going to kind of have a
conversation with Cloud Code to look
through the strategy of programmatic SEO
and see if maybe this integration
playbook would be would be best for
setup claw or maybe it's one of the
other 11 that I have in there. I think
there's 12 playbooks. Um, and now we're
you don't have to know what programmatic
is SEO is. You don't even have to know
what to tell the AI. That's been one of
the biggest changes in the last year
that I've noticed is the whole mantra
used to be like, well, you just have to
know how to harness the AI. You have to
tell it exactly what to do. That is not
true anymore, especially with skills
because now the skill has the strategy
and the SOP in there. Now, it's more
like a co-orker versus an intern that
you're delegating. It's more like a
sparring partner. So, we can say, "Hey,
I don't know if this is right for me.
Will you look into this and do a
thorough analysis of my codebase, my
business, my strategy? You can feed it
numbers, metrics, competitors, and let's
see which ones are right for me.
So, this is the analysis that it came up
with. I'm going to scroll up here to the
top and let me know if I need to zoom in
and or make anything bigger. Um,
>> highlight what you're referring to so
that I know what you're talking about.
Okay, so playbook assessment for setup
claw tier one strong fit build these
first integrations. So basically why we
support 20 integrations
um and then there'd be 20 to 25 pages
that it would create one per
integration.
>> Yeah, these are more like templated
pages, right? This is not like uh rocket
science. Um programmatic SEO can be very
very sophisticated. It it can also be
very simple in that way. You can see
where if you had a 100 integrations, you
know, this would scale pretty far,
right? But they only have 20 today. Um
>> wait, so let's let's pause on that. So
what what it's saying is, hey, look,
this company connects OpenClaw with
HubSpot. Let's create a whole page about
how o openclaw and HubSpot can work well
together for anyone who's looking for
it. And then by the way, we could say we
could do this for you. And they do the
same thing with Gmail. They do the same
thing with Slack. Have a separate page.
It shows how OpenClaw connects with each
one of these. And by the way, if you
want us to install it for you instead of
installing it yourself, here's a button
to sign up. That is brilliant. That is
exactly what I imagine for um program
programmatic SEO and it's a pain in the
ass to create and you're saying I got
the skill here. I'm not just going to
create it. I'm going to create it the
way that we have done it uh for our
clients. Brilliant. And then personas of
course that makes sense too.
>> The tool is one variable. If you have
two tools you want to connect that's two
variables. If you have three tools you
want to connect that's three variables.
And then there's, you know, if you do
some basic math, there's kind of an
exponential relationship here where if I
have 20 integrations and I make a page
each around one tool, that's 20 pages.
When I have two tools, now we're talking
about 400 pages. If I have three tools,
now we're talking about,
>> I don't know what that is, uh, 1,600
pages, right? Uh, and so now we're
really talking about getting some
serious scale,
>> right?
>> Same thing for personas. And you can
even mix and match these, right? Or
let's just say we want to do um you know
uh how to connect OpenClaw for Gmail for
CEOs and then for head of sales for
[sighs]
>> X Y and Z
>> and we're mixing and matching these
strategies together
>> considering how easy it is to do this.
Do you find that it's losing
effectiveness?
>> No, because only smart people like me
and you are are doing it right now. But
also this is stuff that people have been
doing for the past 10 years just not as
many have been doing it because it does
take a lot of time and traditionally
engineering. Programmatic SEO before
even maybe two years ago was an
engineer's job, not a marketer's job.
Now a marketer can come in here and do
this. Take that completely off the plate
of an engineer and say, "Hey, I got it.
I'll spin up the pages. I got the logic.
I'll build the database. I'll structure
all the the information and the
resources. All you have to do is review
my PR and push it live on the site.
>> Okay. All right. I'm with you now. So
now this is one aspect. One marketing
team would have handled this for for a
client. Now it's the skill that's
handling it. I could see how this goes
off. Another thing that he might want is
I don't know is he collecting email
addresses right now? Um
>> no he's not. He's saying book Oh no
actually join the wait list or book a
free call or he he has a lot of calls to
action. There's book a call with me.
There is want us to handle everything.
There's not in the Bay Area get on the
wait list. I can see that this is still
a little jumbled up.
>> One thing that people have done in the
past is say let's create for someone who
joins our email list or our weight list.
Let's create a flow of messages that
goes out to them. Right.
>> You've got that in here. How would that
skill work for him?
>> Yeah. Let's take a look at it. Um, by
the way, those those are just three of
the playbooks. There's a bunch of other
ones that we're looking at here that
we'll
>> I'll just like gloss over here for
people interested. But, um, very very
tip of the iceberg.
>> And Cory and And the way I would work on
this is I would say, I like this. Start
with plan number one. Here's what I want
you to take into account as you do it.
Now, I see the pages and they're up and
running. That's the way that I would
work with this. Right.
>> Exactly. You would say, "Let's do it.
Let me know what you need from me."
>> Yeah. You can you can rein in AI as much
as you want and really keep a close eye
or you can say let it rip. I'm going to
let it run overnight and I'm just going
to check in on it in the morning and see
where it's at and make refinements.
>> What else were you going to show?
>> Yeah, we can show some of the email
stuff. So, I can say, you know, uh this
is great. Thanks. Try to be nice to the
AI so he doesn't um be mean to me later.
Um, let's actually
move on to another project and let's
invoke the email sequences skill.
Specifically, let's look at building a
lead nurturing sequence for anyone who
fills out the form who's expressing
interest in uh a paid service.
And this is going to be the exact same
process where now it's going to invoke a
new skill. We didn't actually do
anything here, but you know, normally
you'd want to like commit, push, save
that branch, maybe go back to a
different branch. Um, or at least save
your progress somehow, right? Uh, we're
just going to kind of skip over this for
now. We're going to go into the email
sequences, but you can see here that
it's going to invoke the email sequence
skill. It's going to read it. It's going
to look at it. It's going to look at all
the different templates. And
specifically for my goal, I said, let's
look at building a lead nurturing
sequence. Again, I'm being a little bit
more prescriptive for the sake of this
demo. You could say, "What should I do
for my business? Is there anything here
valuable for me?" And it'll do some of
that.
>> And it'll go through all the skills and
say what which one I should pick.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Uh since you
mentioned the form and just um that
there was a contact form here on the
site, you know, this is what he
currently has. I'm not even sure if what
we made has uh an information form.
>> It was book a call. You had one CTA on
the very bottom.
>> Yeah. Uh right. Right. And this is
probably Oh, went to cal.com. That's
funny. Um, it's a little placeholder
there, right? But if we did have like a
newsletter form or some sort of contact
form or maybe that was part of the form
to be able to book a call through
cal.com, we're just going to pretend
that that's what it's going to be uh
thinking for us right now. Um,
while it's doing that, by the way, I
have this site called Coding for
Marketers.
>> Mhm. It's supposed to be a step-by-step
let me get you up and started on using
cloud code for marketing uh purposes and
marketing use cases. Try to break things
down really really simply, but you'll
see a lot of the same things that I was
talking about where we're just
explaining like here's what's actually
happening under the hood. So, if any of
this doesn't make sense, um please feel
feel free to like ask me afterwards or
go to the site and see if that maybe
clears it up for you.
Okay, this little report here for us.
Um, oh gosh, it has a lot,
this big report for us.
Here's the full lead nurture sequence
for setup claw. Here's the overview. Um,
the trigger fills out an interest or
contact form, but has not booked a call.
>> Goal is to book a call. Six emails over
14 days. Okay.
>> And the exit condition is that it books
a call. Um, this is interesting too
because what we can do is we can connect
it via API or otherwise to be able to
check to see if a call actually got
booked. Um, you can do that a few
different ways, right? You can check
like a thank you page. You could connect
it to cal.com or savvy or calendarly,
whatever you use. You can check a CRM
record and cloud code also can build
these integrations
again for these marketing purposes where
we're checking now for attribution and
it's being a little bit more smart
versus just enrolling them in an email
sequence that they're like why am I
getting the emails when I already booked
the call you know don't stop asking me
to book a call.
>> I like what it says why six emails and
not eight. This is a hightouch service
$1,000 to $2,400
with a short sales cycle. a buyer is uh
is a founder or exec. They're usually
busy. I see. Yeah. Basically, if they're
not going to buy within six, they're
just going to move on. All right. I like
that it made a decision. Like you said,
this is very opinionated.
>> Mhm. [clears throat] So, here's email
one. I'm not going to read the whole
thing here, but this is following
templates that I found work and again
that are kind of from SOPs that I've
used in the past at other businesses. Uh
it's pretty straightforward. We have a
couple of sentences. Each one is broken
out into a different line, a couple of
bullet points explaining what it is, and
then a big call to action button where
you can then insert a link. Um, here's
email two,
here's email three.
>> How would I interact with this? Would I
like give it my the way that I work
somehow? I'm imagining that's the way
that Michael is going to need to do it,
right? Have some kind of dock that says
how he likes to work. Have some kind of
dock about who he's targeting, that kind
of a thing.
Yeah, that's kind of what I was
mentioning before with the product
marketing context skill. Let me skip
over that to that here really quickly
because it'll show you um yeah, what I
realized was that the context is really
important. And the more information you
can give it about you and your business,
the better. And so this skill asks for
really basic information about your
product, your target audience, personas,
problems, competition, your own
differentiation, what you're trying to
do differently, um, objection handling,
switching dynamics, right? This is like
marketing, psychology, uh, and
foundational stuff really, really
quickly. And then you'll see in every
other
skill like this is the one we were just
on on the email sequences. One of the
first things that is tasked to do is to
check the product marketing context
skill so that it has all that
information top of mind.
>> Okay,
>> we don't have that in here and we kind
of skip through it because uh we're just
trying to go fast and show people. The
first thing I would do is I would go
invoke that skill to have Claude ask me
questions about who I'm targeting.
>> Yeah.
>> And what I'm about. Got it. So start
with that skill. Then the rest build on
it. All right. And now it made some
assumptions based on the way that a
business like this would run. And it
created this series of emails.
>> I like it a lot. Now I understand how it
works. How would you interact with this?
Would you take this into another
document and start editing or would you
start to give it some feedback first and
then take the output and edit?
>> Yeah. So, um this is where a tool like
the S code or cursor might come in handy
where sometimes you're looking at this
and you're like this is a little bit
hard for me to edit. I can't actually
click in and change things. So you can
tell Claude, um,
put these emails in files for me to look
at so I can make edits directly.
>> Okay, I got it. Is there one other one
that you want to demonstrate before
before we finish up?
>> Yeah, let me show you the SEO audit
skill because um that'll also show kind
of the report and a lot of the technical
things that people don't like to do. Um,
so let's say uh now use the SEO audit
skill
and give me a full report of what you
did to improve the site. This will do a
lot more once you have a lot more pages,
right? So let's say we went and we
created all the programmatic SEO pages
around integrations. So now we have
1,600 integrations based on all the
different permutations of the three
different combinations of what people
want to integrate or even for the
personas or locations. There's going to
be a lot of stuff in there that's going
to be wrong. And what's the point of
having 1,600 pages that don't rank
because Google doesn't even see a
metatitle in there.
>> So what the SEO audit is going to do is
again you don't have to be a marketer to
know this stuff. You just have to know
that this SEO audit skill is probably um
close enough to uh following the best
practices for you. And then it's going
to look through every single page, how
it renders, the content, the structure,
the metadata. Um it's even look going to
look at things like schema,
um internal linking strategy. Uh it's
going to look at um the information
hierarchy of the page, you know, so your
headings versus your body text versus
your images.
Um, and it's going to make all the
necessary updates to get you up to snuff
on where you should be SEO wise. This
this is stuff that I feel bad about
because um this is the kind of stuff
that WordPress agencies have been
charging their clients tens of thousands
of dollars for that now can be done
within 60 seconds.
And there there's going to be a
reckoning of people are like why am I
paying so much for an SEO agency to just
update metad descriptions on my website.
Um it to be fair it would be very
timeconuming to do that manually and
I've done that before. There was times
where I updated hundreds of uh alt text
tags on images on a website because um
we forgot to and someone had to do it.
But now Cloud Code can go through and do
this within minutes. And the amount of
tokens that it's burning, you can see
here, this is probably like three, it
says three and a 3.3,000 tokens. I mean,
this is pennies on the dollar, right? So
the leverage is is crazy. There's no
reason why you wouldn't want to do this.
Okay. Would you go over to the list of
skills that are available on GitHub? I
can't believe that this is just so
easily available.
just give me like a quick description of
some of them and show us the ones that
we may not pay attention to that are
super powerful and worth worth using.
>> Uh yeah, I'll do that really quick and
then I'll come back to the SEO audit to
finish that thought. Um I've tried to
cover most of the things that I do
dayto-day. One of the other things that
I'm learning just as as a disclaimer is
that skills and like everything at AI
are very fluid and so they're changing
every day and the best practices and um
and so what you're looking at today
might look a little bit different
tomorrow or by the time that you're
seeing this recording. Don't be alarmed.
We're making changes and optimizations,
right? So I'm just covering my bases.
You'll see here that there's versions,
too. So anything that looks a little bit
different, um there's a change log
within GitHub. But um on the analytic
side of things, man, this is something
that I was scared of forever because
before three years ago, I wasn't
technical. And so I'd be like, "Hey
developer, can you go through and like
set up event tracking so that we have an
idea of where our customers come from
and what they're doing in the onboarding
and then they would have to go through
and um you know, how do I define the
events? How do I set up uh Google Tag
Manager in this way? How do I make sure
that the UTM parameter persists through
the cross domain tracking? All that kind
of stuff is um covered in these two
skills. There's a lot of content and
page skills, competitor comparison
pages, blog posts for content strategy.
There's a social media one down here
which I just used the other day to
connect to my social media platform
typefully. And via their API, I was able
to build a bunch of video content in
cloud code and then automatically
schedule it out through typefully which
is incredible.
Um there's a lot more inapp types of
programs like um onboarding
uh free tools as a strategy. Uh we have
things like the referral programs, um
the signup flow, CRO, right? These are
types of things that are more like
conversion rate optimization, growth
hacking, um you know, you're getting a
lot of free users, but now those free
users aren't converting into paid users.
Those are the types of things you would
want to do in order to convert more free
users into paid users, right? Or just
get more people to become customers. Um
pricing strategy. Uh there's things like
SEO in here. Um one other thing you'll
notice towards the bottom too is that
I've started to build out a tool
directory of all the different marketing
tools that have cloud code friendly
connectors, MCPs, APIs, CLIs,
>> and even custom scripts to be able to
connect to those even if they don't have
a direct integration. But you can build
that integration yourself thanks to
cloud code because it's amazing at
coding. Um,
so there's gonna be more in the future.
You'll see ones too like uh paid ads
where this is kind of like a big
umbrella for all the major channels,
Google, Meta, LinkedIn, um, Reddit, Tik
Tok, and these are going to be following
a lot of the best practices for running
um, paid ads. And then we do have some
specific instructions for each one of
these. To be honest, these will probably
end up being split out into individual
skills for each one of the platforms as
we learn more and more about what is
useful to the AI.
>> And how much is it going to do? I I can
see that with the SEO skill, it could
actually programmatically create pages
for me with ads. What are you going to
do?
>> Uh, for example, for even one of my own
SAS companies, True List, uh, I have
Cloud Code connect to Google Ads and I
have it generate weekly reports. I have
it go and update copy for headlines in
different campaigns. I have it uh adjust
budgets. So, it's almost like an
interface to Google Ads where I'm just
telling it what I want it to do within
Google Ads and it's going and doing that
for me. Um,
a lot of these ad managers have really
mature uh developer tools, APIs, and
other ways to connect with them. And so,
Cloud Code has a very easy time doing a
lot within them. Um, you can even build
your own apps internally where if you if
you want to install a nano banana and
you want to have it kind of
programmatically generate ads for you
and then upload them into meta, you can
do that. I have another SAS product
actually, Swipe Well, a little plug that
we're working on ways to do that for you
and then it's going to connect into
Cloud Code or whatever other agentic
tool of your choice. Um, but just like
the SEO skill, this is going to do a lot
of the work for you. All right, let's
take a look at what you were working on
in the background. It was still
thinking.
>> Yeah. Um, here's all the changes that it
made. And this is funny because you can
see that we just made a single page
website, right? We barely gave it any
information. It's literally one page,
one project. How much could there really
be to do on a single page like this?
Well, like I mentioned before, there's a
lot of averages, especially when it
spins up a new website. They're not
thinking about SEO from the forefront,
right? Only a marketer does. A developer
doesn't really care about a lot of that
stuff. And so there was a lot to do. The
site had no technical SEO
infrastructure. No robots.txt, no site
map, no structured data, no open graph
text, so on and so forth. It found all
the issues. XML sitemap, um, Twitter
cards, canonical URLs. These are all
things that would you would be dead in
the water if you launched this. Google
would not even know that you had existed
unless you actually went through and
fixed all these things.
>> All right, this is freaking killer.
What's the website for anyone who wants
to follow up with you?
>> You can go to um coding
formarketers.com.
You can also go to marketing-skills.com
>> and notice on that page there's the
Discord. Exactly. I jumped in front of
you to say that there are no communities
really for people who both care about
vibe coding and care about marketing. It
feels like the worlds are still too far
apart. You are if not the first big
voice in this space, you are definitely
one of the first ones who are saying,
"Hey, building is really fun with these
new tools. It's also damn fun to use
these AI tools to market to promote to
get users."
>> All right. Thanks. Thanks, Corey. I have
a wind.
