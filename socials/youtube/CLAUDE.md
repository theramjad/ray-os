# YouTube

Ray's YouTube channel data and research.

- `ab-tests/` — Ray's own title and thumbnail A/B test results
- `analysis/` — Competitor video transcript analysis (hooks, structure, retention patterns)
- `self-audit/` — Ray's own videos audited against competitor research findings
- `transcripts/` — Downloaded video transcripts organized by channel

## A/B Test Logging

When recording A/B test results, include a timestamp on each round:

```markdown
### Title A/B Test Round N (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
```

This tracks when results were captured so we can see how quickly tests converge and how much time passed between rounds.
