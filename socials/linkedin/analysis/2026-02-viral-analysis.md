## ANALYSIS: VIRAL PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### 1. WRITING STYLE PATTERNS

#### A. "The Hook Formula" (used by 90%+ of high-engagement posts)
- **Line 1 is EVERYTHING.** The first line must create curiosity, shock, or emotional response
- **Top hook types:**
  - **Shocking stat:** "Anthropic just hit $380B valuation" / "The UK just lost £3.8 billion" / "6.8 billion people have never used AI"
  - **Bold/controversial claim:** "Figma AI is practically dead" / "Claude just killed prompt engineering"
  - **Personal vulnerability:** "Im 19 years old, and im running out of time" / "Cambridge! I can't believe it."
  - **Dramatic change:** "As of today, Paragon is no longer an embedded iPaaS"
  - **Question hook:** "still feeling left out with Claude Code?"

#### B. "Short Sentence Stacking"
- Nearly every viral post uses **very short sentences** (3-10 words)
- One idea per line
- Heavy use of line breaks (every sentence gets its own line)
- Example pattern:
  ```
  Enterprise scales with margin.
  Consumer scales with cash burn.
  ```

#### C. "The Arrow Pattern" (→)
- Used by 30%+ of posts for key points
- Creates visual scan-ability
- Example: "→ sub-agents: fire off 3 tasks simultaneously"

#### D. "Bullet Point Data"
- Comparisons formatted as parallel bullet points (▪️ or ✅ or ⚡)
- Side-by-side data creates instant comprehension
- Works especially well for "X vs Y" content

#### E. "The Knowledge Gap"
- "But here's the thing most people don't realize..."
- "What's missing is the how"
- Creates FOMO and positions author as insider

#### F. All Lowercase Style
- David Arnoux (233 reactions, 359 comments) wrote entirely in lowercase
- Creates casual, conversational, "I'm texting you" feel
- Signals authenticity over polish

#### G. "The CTA Close"
- "wdyt?" (what do you think?)
- Rhetorical questions: "Are you optimising for today's balance sheet, or tomorrow's unfair advantage?"
- Engagement bait: "1. 👍 like 2. 💬 comment 3. 🔄 repost"

## THE DEFINITIVE PLAYBOOK: How to Write Viral LinkedIn Posts (2026)

### RULE 1: THE HOOK IS EVERYTHING
Your first 1-2 lines determine if anyone reads further. LinkedIn truncates after ~210 characters.

**Top-performing hook formulas from this dataset:**

1. **"The Shocking Number"** — Lead with a jaw-dropping stat
   - "Anthropic just hit $380B valuation" (723 reactions)
   - "I spent $500K renovating our new HQ" (568 reactions)
   - "6.8 billion people have never used AI" (344 reactions)

2. **"The Bold Claim"** — Make a statement people can't scroll past
   - "Figma AI is practically dead" (2,680 reactions)
   - "Claude just killed prompt engineering" (92 reactions)
   - "As of today, Paragon is no longer an embedded iPaaS" (698 reactions)

3. **"The Vulnerability Hook"** — Start with raw honesty
   - "Im 19 years old, and im running out of time" (152 reactions)
   - "Cambridge! I can't believe it" (254 reactions, 111 comments)
   - "I was selected as one of 15 creators" (77 reactions, 42 comments)

4. **"The Curiosity Gap"** — Tease something people need to know
   - "The Most Important Metric is MISSING from Your Meta Ads Manager" (497 reactions)
   - "When it came to the final details, my co-founder had one hard rule" (568 reactions)
   - "If you're ever wondering why VCs aren't responding to your emails..." (286 reactions)

5. **"The Person A vs Person B"** — Two paths, one lesson
   - "Two people both want financial freedom..." (310 reactions)
   - Used by Ali Abdaal - pure storytelling, no formatting tricks

### RULE 2: FORMAT FOR SCANNING
LinkedIn is a scrolling platform. Make your post scan-able:

- **One idea per line** (not per paragraph)
- **→ Arrows** for key points (used by 35% of top posts)
- **▪️ or ✅ or ⚡ Emoji bullets** for lists
- **❌/✅ Contrast pairs** for mindset shifts (Ali Abdaal pattern)
- **Bold Unicode text** for headers (Karolina Sarek pattern: 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱)
- **Numbered steps** for frameworks (Peter Quadrel: 1-6 steps)
- **Short sentences.** Three to ten words max. Stack them.

### RULE 3: CHOOSE YOUR MEDIA WISELY

**Ranked by average engagement:**
1. **Carousel/Document (9-13 pages)** — Avg 340 reactions. The #1 organic format.
   - Dark background + white text for cover slides
   - Each page = one concept
   - "Guide" or "Playbook" framing
   - Engagement bait ("comment X to get it") drives comments

2. **Event/Multiple Photos** — Avg 896 reactions (small sample).
   - Real photos from events/conferences
   - "+2" format showing multiple images

3. **Meme/Humor Images** — Avg 270 reactions.
   - Must be RELEVANT to your audience's pain points
   - The image does the work, text is minimal

4. **Custom Data Visualizations** — Avg 344 reactions.
   - Original graphics showing data in novel ways
   - Dot grids, comparison charts, custom infographics

5. **Video** — Avg 200 reactions (organic).
   - Celebrity/expert clips perform well
   - Product demos with bold claims

6. **Text Only** — Avg 175 reactions.
   - Can STILL go viral with the right story (Sam Ellis: 254, Amanda Zhu: 568)
   - Best for personal stories and parables

### RULE 4: END WITH A CTA
Every viral post has a call-to-action:

- **Question CTA:** "wdyt?" / "What would you do?" / "Which is your fav?"
- **Engagement bait CTA:** "Comment X to get the guide" (drives 300+ comments)
- **Rhetorical CTA:** "Are you optimising for today's balance sheet, or tomorrow's unfair advantage?"
- **Follow CTA:** "Hit the 🔔 on my profile"
- **Share CTA:** "Repost to help others"

### RULE 5: THE 8 VIRAL ARCHETYPES

1. **"The Data Bomb"** — Shocking stat → comparison → analysis → CTA
2. **"The Carousel Guide"** — How-to packaged in swipeable document
3. **"The Personal Story"** — Vulnerability + achievement + gratitude
4. **"The Bold Claim"** — Controversial statement → evidence → vision
5. **"The Meme Drop"** — Ultra-short text + viral-worthy image
6. **"The Contrarian Take"** — "Everyone thinks X, actually Y" + data
7. **"The Person A/B Parable"** — Two paths, one lesson, narrative format
8. **"The News + Insight"** — Breaking news + "here's what it means for you"

### RULE 6: IMAGE DESIGN PATTERNS
Based on the top-performing image posts:

1. **Dark backgrounds** with white/bright text (carousel covers)
2. **Large bold typography** for meme-style images
3. **Custom data viz** > stock charts (Emre's dot grid: 344 reactions)
4. **Real photos** from events/offices > stock photos (Amanda Zhu, Nate H.)
5. **Monospace/retro fonts** for tech-related carousels
6. **Flag emojis** (🇬🇧🇫🇷🇩🇪) for international content = visual scanning
7. **Screenshots** of real products/tools as proof

### 6. WHAT TO AVOID
- Corporate language / press release tone
- Posts without clear hooks
- Walls of text without line breaks
- Hashtag spam (1-3 hashtags max, at the very end)
- Pure self-promotion without story/value framing
- Being too polished (lowercase + casual tone outperforms corporate)
- Long intros before getting to the point
- Using "I'm excited to announce" (boring hook)
- Posting without an image/carousel when you could have one
