# Desktop App: SSH Connections

The Claude Code desktop app now supports SSH connections to remote servers. Add a server, connect, choose a remote folder, and Claude Code runs directly on that machine. Useful for quick changes to small side projects hosted on a VPS without needing Git or a full deploy pipeline.
