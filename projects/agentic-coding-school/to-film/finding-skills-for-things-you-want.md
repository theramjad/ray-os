# Finding Skills for Things You Want

Ask the AI to go out and find skills for you — you won't always discover them on X.

Explore skill directories or ask Claude Code to search for and install skills relevant to what you're building. Example: PlanetScale launched database skills for agents (Postgres, MySQL, Vitess) that give agents the context to make better decisions and write better queries.
