# Desktop App: Previews

Claude Code desktop can now run your app locally and click through it like a user — taking screenshots and verifying buttons work. You can also select a specific element in the preview and ask Claude to change it directly (e.g. "make this button green"). Supports mobile view and persistent sessions across server restarts.
