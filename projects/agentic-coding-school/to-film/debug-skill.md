# /debug Built-in Skill

Claude Code now ships with a built-in `/debug` skill. Describe an issue you observed (e.g. a hook that didn't trigger) and it'll diagnose it using the logs stored in your `.claude` folder. After fixing the issue, use `/rewind` to restore the conversation to before you asked the debug question.
