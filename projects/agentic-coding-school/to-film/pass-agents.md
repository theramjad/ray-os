# Pass agents

## Use two-pass agents for reliability

**Implication:** Single-pass generation drops constraints; a second pass catches misses.

- Pass 1: generate solution
- Pass 2: a "compliance checker" prompt: "Check against requirements; list violations; patch."

This is basically unit tests for instruction following.

**Fewer global rules, more staged constraints**

Split into phases:
- Phase A: "Generate a clean solution that passes tests."
- Phase B: "Now refactor to match style X and naming Y."
- Phase C: "Now optimize."

You'll get higher overall success than dumping everything at once.
