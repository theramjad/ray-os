# Always force a constraint restatement before code

**Implication:** Many failures come from the model silently dropping constraints.

Add a tiny step:

> "Before coding, list the requirements you will satisfy (max 6 bullets). Then implement."

This surfaces missing constraints early and reduces "oops I forgot."
