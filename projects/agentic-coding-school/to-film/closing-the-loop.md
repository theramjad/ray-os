# Closing the Loop

See Obsidian for notes and make graphics here too

## Concept

Close the loop by connecting your agentic workflow end-to-end — input to output and back again.

**Example: TikTok Video Pipeline**
- Write code that generates TikTok videos automatically
- Instead of using the TikTok API (which gets nerfed), have it queue videos for a human to manually upload — avoids platform restrictions
- One day later, have an agent check back on the uploaded videos, pull any insights (views, comments, engagement), and update the content or related notes with what it learned

## Key Points
- "Closing the loop" = the agent doesn't just produce output, it also monitors and learns from the result
- Human-in-the-loop upload step sidesteps API risk while keeping the rest automated
- The delayed feedback step (check next day) is what makes it a *loop* vs a one-shot pipeline
- Can apply to any content workflow: YouTube, blog posts, newsletters, etc.
