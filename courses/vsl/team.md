Hey, it's Ray. If you're a team lead, engineering manager, or someone responsible for how your engineering team ships, this is for you.

Your team is probably already using Claude Code. The question is whether they're using it well. Because what I'm seeing across companies right now is a massive productivity gap forming inside teams. A handful of engineers figure out Claude Code on their own and become 5 to 10 times more productive. The rest try it, get stuck in loops, watch it make the same mistakes over and over, and quietly go back to how they were working before. And that gap is only getting wider.

The companies that are pulling ahead aren't just giving their teams access to Claude Code. They're training them. How to manage context so the model doesn't lose track of what it's doing. How to use subagents, hooks, MCP servers, and context engineering to make it work inside real codebases, not just toy projects. How to actually ship faster without sacrificing code quality.

That's why I built this. It's the most comprehensive Claude Code training you'll find. Over a thousand individual engineers have already taken it, many from companies you'd recognize. It covers everything from the basics for people who are brand new, all the way through advanced techniques like subagent parallelization, context engineering, and refactoring workflows that work in codebases with over a million lines of code. Over 8 hours of content, 140 concise videos, updated within days of every Claude Code release.

The results are real. Teams that go through this training double and sometimes triple their output per engineer. Non-engineers, designers and PMs, start putting up PRs without waiting for engineering. New hires onboard in days instead of months because they're pair programming with an AI that knows the codebase. And the engineers who were already good become the ones who set the standard for everyone else.

Now here's how it works for teams. We start with a 60-minute strategy session. And I want to be clear, this is not a sales call. It's a working session.

The first 10 minutes, I review your intake form and get a clear picture of your team, your stack, your codebase, and where you're hitting walls.

Then for the next 35 minutes, we get into the actual work. I either demo the exact techniques from the training that map to your challenges, or we work on a real problem your team is facing right now. If your team struggles with large codebases, I'll show context engineering and hierarchical CLAUDE.md patterns. If speed is the issue, I'll show subagent workflows and parallelization. If code quality is the concern, I'll show how to use Claude Code as a senior reviewer with testing workflows and pre-commit hooks.

Then in the last 15 minutes, we build a custom implementation roadmap together. Not a generic rollout plan. A specific plan for your team. Start with X, then Y, then Z. What they learn first, how they adopt it, and how you measure whether it's working.

You walk away from that session with four things. A custom roadmap tailored to your team. A recording you can share with your team and decision makers. Techniques you can use immediately, even if you never buy anything. And clear next steps so you know exactly how to move forward.
