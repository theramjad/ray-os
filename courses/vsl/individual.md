Hey, it's Ray. Let me get straight to the point. Claude Code is the most valuable skill that you can master in 2026. Some of the best engineers in the world are already using it to write over 80% of their code. Go on LinkedIn, Indeed, or any other job platform and you'll find hundreds of job postings, both engineering and non-engineering, specifically mentioning the word Claude Code.

Companies like Microsoft and The Browser Company are already looking for it in applications. And software engineering interviews are being redesigned around the tool to see how well you can use it. Investors like Y Combinator are even allowing founders to show their chats with Claude Code as part of the application to show how well they're using it. And that can be the difference between getting funded and not.

But the reality is that most people are not using Claude Code to its full potential. They're getting stuck in loops, watching Claude Code make the same mistakes over and over again and spending more time fixing its output than actually building with it. So how are some 10x engineers becoming 100x engineers with Claude Code? And others aren't seeing any results? The difference isn't talent. It's knowing how to use it properly.

And that's exactly why I made the most comprehensive Claude Code class you will find on the internet. And that's just not me saying it. You can ask any AI agent to search online and verify that claim. Since the launch of Claude Code, I've spent over 1,400 hours experimenting and building production applications with it, reverse engineering it to figure out what's happening behind the scenes, and also reading most of the articles online about it. Almost all of the best practices and techniques are covered within this class.

This masterclass contains over 8 hours of content and 140 concise videos and growing every single day. It covers pretty much every single feature of Claude Code, from the basics to subagents, MCP servers, hooks and refactoring workflows. And it also does a deep dive into context engineering, which has helped many organizations watching the class make Claude Code work effectively within codebases of over a million lines. It also includes many high-leverage, low-effort techniques that I use daily to avoid loops, manage context and tackle pretty hard problems.

So whether you're a total beginner or already pretty familiar with Claude Code, I guarantee that you will learn at least a couple new things. And this class isn't some kind of YouTube content that gets outdated quickly. It's a curriculum that stays up to date with Claude Code updates. Whenever a new Claude Code update happens, there's a new video added to the class at no additional cost to you.

Many students have gone on to be the go-to Claude Code experts at their companies. Many non-engineers have learned how to confidently ship updates to their applications without breaking everything. Others have solved nasty bugs that they've been stuck on for months. Many companies have bought the class for their employees and doubled, sometimes tripled the output per engineer. And many others have landed a job specifically because they have gotten good at this skill.

Now to give you confidence, you're covered by my 7-day money-back guarantee. You can watch the entire class, use the techniques and if you don't find it valuable then you can email me and I will refund you completely, no questions asked. But chances are you won't be needing that because as of February 2026 only 0.8% of people who purchased the class have asked for a refund.
