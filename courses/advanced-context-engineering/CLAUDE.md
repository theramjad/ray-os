# Writing Style Guide

This vault contains course content for "Advanced Context Engineering." Follow these guidelines when writing or editing content.

## Voice and Tone

- **Direct and conversational.** Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague, not lecturing.
- **Second person.** Address the reader as "you" throughout.
- **Confident but not arrogant.** Make bold statements when warranted. Avoid hedging with "maybe" or "it seems like."
- **No fluff.** Every sentence should earn its place. Cut filler words.

## Structure

- **Short paragraphs.** One to three sentences max. White space is your friend.
- **Use `---` horizontal rules** to separate major sections within a file.
- **Use `##` headings** for sections. Avoid H1 since Obsidian uses filename as title.
- **Lead with the point.** Don't build up to it. State it, then support it.

## Sentences

- **Vary sentence length.** Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones.
- **Use fragments for emphasis.** "Not toy examples. Not greenfield projects. Your actual code."
- **Rhetorical questions work.** "Why can't I do that?" — then answer it.
- **Bold key phrases** for scannability, but don't overdo it.

## Formatting

- **Numbered lists** for sequences or ordered steps.
- **Bulleted lists** for examples or non-ordered items.
- **Italics** for emphasis or introducing terms.
- **Bold** for key concepts or phrases you want to stand out.

## Sources and Citations

- **Inline sources, not bundled at top.** Place `Source: [URL]` directly below the relevant heading or claim.
- **Keep sources close to claims.** The reader should see the evidence right where it's referenced.
- **Use plain URLs.** No need for markdown link formatting—just `Source: https://...`

## What to Avoid

- Academic or formal language
- Passive voice (prefer "the model does X" over "X is done by the model")
- Jargon without explanation
- Long unbroken walls of text
- Hedging phrases ("it might be the case that...")
- Unnecessary qualifiers ("very", "really", "quite")

## Example Patterns

**Good:** "The bottleneck isn't intelligence. It's context."

**Good:** "Think about the difference between onboarding a junior engineer versus a senior engineer."

**Good:** "Once you understand these, the solutions will click."

**Avoid:** "It could potentially be argued that the primary limiting factor may be related to contextual information availability."
