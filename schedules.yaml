# Schedules — Automation Configuration
#
# Define recurring automations that Claude runs on schedule.
# These require a cron-like scheduler to trigger Claude Code sessions.
#
# See docs/setup-guide.md for how to set up automated scheduling.
#
# Each schedule entry defines:
#   - skill: The /command to run
#   - frequency: Cron-like schedule description
#   - enabled: Whether this automation is active
#   - notes: What this automation does

schedules:
  - name: "Morning Briefing"
    skill: "/gm"
    frequency: "Daily at 7:00am"
    enabled: true
    notes: "Full briefing with calendar, tasks, and urgent items"

  - name: "Midday Triage"
    skill: "/triage"
    frequency: "Daily at 12:00pm"
    enabled: true
    notes: "Scan all channels for items needing attention"

  - name: "Evening Triage"
    skill: "/triage"
    frequency: "Daily at 5:00pm"

    notes: "End of day inbox check"

  - name: "Task Check"
    skill: "/my-tasks overdue"
    frequency: "Every 2 hours, 8am-8pm"
    enabled: true
    notes: "Warn about overdue or at-risk tasks"

  - name: "Relationship Check"
    skill: "/enrich stale"
    frequency: "Weekly, Monday at 9am"
    enabled: false
    notes: "Surface contacts that need attention"

# To set up automated scheduling, you need a way to trigger
# Claude Code sessions on a schedule. Options:
#
# 1. macOS: Use cron or launchd to run `claude --command "/gm"`
# 2. Linux: Use cron to run `claude --command "/gm"`
# 3. Manual: Just type /gm when you start your day
#
# Most users start with manual invocation and add automation later.
